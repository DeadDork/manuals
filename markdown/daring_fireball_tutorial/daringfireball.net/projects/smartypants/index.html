<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/SmartyPants_1.5.1.zip">SmartyPants 1.5.1</a> (20 KB) — Fri 12 Mar 2004
</p>
<p>
<a href="index.html#version_1.5.1">What&#8217;s new?</a>
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
SmartyPants is a free web publishing plug-in for Movable Type, Blosxom,
and BBEdit that easily translates plain ASCII punctuation characters
into &#8220;smart&#8221; typographic punctuation HTML entities.
</p>

<p>
SmartyPants can perform the following transformations:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Straight quotes ( &#34; and &#39; ) into &#8220;curly&#8221; quote HTML entities
</li>

<li>
Backticks-style quotes (<code>``like this''</code>) into &#8220;curly&#8221; quote HTML entities
</li>

<li>
Dashes (&#8220;<code>--</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>---</code>&#8221;) into en- and em-dash entities
</li>

<li>
Three consecutive dots (&#8220;<code>...</code>&#8221;) into an ellipsis entity
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This means you can write, edit, and save your posts using plain old
ASCII straight quotes, plain dashes, and plain dots, but your published
posts (and final HTML output) will appear with smart quotes, em-dashes,
and proper ellipses.
</p>

<p>
SmartyPants is a combination plug-in &#8212; a single plug-in file that works with Movable Type, Blosxom, and BBEdit. It can also be used from a Unix-style command-line.
</p>

<p>
SmartyPants does not modify characters within <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag blocks. Typically, these tags are used to display text where smart quotes and other &#8220;smart punctuation&#8221; would not be appropriate, such as source code or example markup.
</p>


<h2>Version Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Movable Type: 2.5 or later (including Movable Type 3.0)</li>

<li>Blosxom: 2.0 or later</li>

<li>BBEdit: 5.1 or later</li>

<li>Perl: 5.005 or later</li>

</ul>


<h2>MT-Textile Integration</h2>

<p>
Movable Type users should also note that SmartyPants can work in
conjunction with <a href="http://bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php" title="MT-Textile">Brad Choate&#8217;s MT-Textile plug-in</a>.
</p>

<p>
MT-Textile is a port of Dean Allen&#8217;s original Textile project to Perl
and Movable Type. MT-Textile by itself only translates Textile markup
to HTML. However, if SmartyPants is also installed, MT-Textile will
call on SmartyPants to educate quotes, dashes, and ellipses,
automatically. Using SmartyPants in conjunction with MT-Textile
requires no modifications to your Movable Type templates.
</p>

<p>
Textile is Dean Allen&#8217;s &#8220;humane web text generator&#8221;, an easy-to-write
and easy-to-read shorthand for writing text for the web. An <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/" title="Textile">online
Textile web application</a> is available at Mr. Allen&#8217;s site.
</p>



<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
Installation instructions and documentation are provided in the download package.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>
Upgrading from any previous version of SmartyPants is easy. Just replace your old &#8220;SmartyPants.pl&#8221; plug-in file with the new one. You don&#8217;t need to change any of your templates to reap the benefits of the numerous bug fixes. (You will need to change your templates, however, if you wish to use the new en- and em-dash shortcut.)
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>
Because proper typographic punctuation looks sharp.
</p>

<h2>Why Not?</h2>

<p>
    For one thing, you might not care.
</p>

<p>
    Most normal, mentally stable individuals do not take notice of proper
    typographic punctuation. Many design and typography nerds, however,
    break out in a nasty rash when they encounter, say, a restaurant sign
    that uses a straight apostrophe to spell &#8220;Joe&#8217;s&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
    If you&#8217;re the sort of person who just doesn&#8217;t care, you might well want
    to continue not caring. Using straight quotes &#8212; and sticking to the
    7-bit ASCII character set in general &#8212; is certainly a simpler way to
    live.
</p>

<p>
    Even if you <em>do</em> care about accurate typography, you still might want to
    think twice before educating the quote characters in your weblog. One
    side effect of publishing curly quote HTML entities is that it makes
    your weblog a bit harder for others to quote from using copy-and-paste.
    What happens is that when they copy text from your blog, they copy the
    8-bit curly quote characters (as well as the 8-bit characters for
    em-dashes and ellipses, if you use these options). These characters are
    not standard across different text encoding methods, which is why they
    need to be encoded as HTML entities.
</p>

<p>
    People copying text from your weblog, however, may not notice that
    you&#8217;re using curly quotes, and they&#8217;ll go ahead and paste the unencoded
    8-bit characters copied from their browser into an email message or
    their own weblog. When pasted as raw &#8220;smart quotes&#8221;, these characters
    are likely to get mangled beyond recognition.
</p>

<p>
    That said, my own opinion is that any decent text editor or email client
    should be able to stupefy smart quote characters into their 7-bit
    equivalents, and I don&#8217;t consider it my problem if you&#8217;re using an
    indecent text editor or email client.
</p>


<h2 id="shortcomings">Algorithmic Shortcomings</h2>

<p>
	One situation in which quotes will get curled the wrong way is when
	apostrophes are used at the start of leading contractions. For example:
</p>
	
<pre>
	'Twas the night before Christmas.
</pre>
	
<p>
	In the case above, SmartyPants will turn the apostrophe into an opening
	single-quote, when in fact it should be a closing one. I don&#8217;t think
	this problem can be solved in the general case &#8212; every word processor
	I&#8217;ve tried gets this wrong as well. In such cases, it&#8217;s best to use the
	proper HTML entity for closing single-quotes (<code>&amp;#8217;</code> or <code>&amp;rsquo;</code>) by
	hand, or to use the raw UTF-8 quote character ( ’ ).

<h2 id="history">Version History</h2>


<h3 id="version_1.5.1">1.5.1: Fri 12 Mar 2004</h3>
    
<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a goof where if you had SmartyPants 1.5.0 installed,
    but didn’t have Markdown installed, when SmartyPants checked
    for Markdown’s presence, it created a blank entry in MT’s
    global hash of installed text filters. This showed up in MT’s
    Text Formatting pop-up menu as a blank entry.</p></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="version_1.5">1.5: Tue 9 Mar 2004</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>SmartyPants now features automatic integration with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a>,
my new text formatting plug-in. If Markdown and SmartyPants are both installed as Movable Type plug-ins, SmartyPants will add a new global text filter,
“Markdown With Smartypants”.</p></li>
<li><p>Preliminary command-line options parsing. See the POD documentation
for details, if you're into this sort of thing.</p></li>
<li><p>dot-space-dot-space-dot now counts as an ellipsis.
This is the style used by Project Gutenberg:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/faq/index.shtml#V.110">http://www.gutenberg.net/faq/index.shtml#V.110</a>
<br />(Thanks to Fred Condo for the patch.)</p></li>
<li><p>Added <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> to the list of tags to skip (pre, code, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="version_1.4.1">1.4.1: Sat 8 Nov 2003</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
The bug fix from 1.4 for dashes followed by quotes with no
intervening spaces now actually works.
</p></li>

<li><p>
&#8220;&amp;nbsp;&#8221; now counts as whitespace where necessary. (Thanks to
Greg Knauss for the patch.)
</p></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="version_1.4">1.4: Mon 30 Jun 2003</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
   Improved the HTML tokenizer so that it will parse nested &lt;&gt; pairs
        up to five levels deep. Previously, it only parsed up to two
        levels. What we *should* do is allow for any arbitrary level of
        nesting, but to do so, we would need to use Perl&#8217;s ?? construct
        (see Fried&#8217;s &#8220;Mastering Regular Expressions&#8221;, 2nd Ed., pp.
        328-331), and sadly, this would only work in Perl 5.6 or later.
        SmartyPants still supports Perl 5.00503. I suppose we could test
        for the version and build a regex accordingly, but I don&#8217;t think
        I want to maintain two separate patterns.
</p></li>

<li><p>
   Thanks to Stepan Riha, the tokenizer now handles HTML comments:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- comment --&gt;
</pre>

<p>
   and PHP-style processor instructions:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php code ?&gt;
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>
   The quote educator now handles situations where dashes are used
        without whitespace, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
"dashes"--without spaces--"are tricky"
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>
   Special case for decade abbreviations like this: the &#8217;80s.
        This only works for the sequence apostrophe-digit-digit-s.
</p>
</li>

</ul>


<h3 id="version_1.3">1.3: Wed 14 May 2003</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
   Plugged the biggest hole in SmartyPants&#8217;s smart quotes algorithm.
	Previous versions were hopelessly confused by single-character
	quote tokens, such as:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Tricky!&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
	The problem was that the EducateQuotes() function works on each
	token separately, with no means of getting surrounding context
	from the previous or next tokens. The solution is to curl these
	single-character quote tokens as a special case, <em>before</em> calling
	EducateQuotes().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
   New single-quotes backtick mode for <code>smarty_pants</code> attribute.
	The only way to turn it on is to include &#8220;B&#8221; in the configuration
	string, e.g. to translate backtick quotes, dashes, and ellipses:
</p>
<pre><code>
smarty_pants="Bde"
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
   Fixed a bug where an opening quote would get curled the wrong way
	if the quote started with three dots, e.g.:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;p&gt;"...meanwhile"&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
   Fixed a bug where opening quotes would get curled the wrong way
	if there were double sets of quotes within each other, e.g.:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;p&gt;"'Some' people."&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
   Due to popular demand, four consecutive dots (&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;) will now be
	turned into an ellipsis followed by a period. Previous versions
	would turn this into a period followed by an ellipsis. If you
	really want a period-then-ellipsis sequence, escape the first
	period with a backslash: <code>\....</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
   Removed &#8220;&amp;&#8221; from our home-grown punctuation class, since it
	denotes an entity, not a literal ampersand punctuation
	character. This fixes a bug where SmartyPants would mis-curl
	the opening quote in something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
"&amp;#8230;whatever"
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
   SmartyPants has always had a special case where it looks for
	&#8220;<code>'s</code>&#8221; in situations like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;i&gt;Custer&lt;/i&gt;'s Last Stand

</code></pre><p>
	This special case is now case-insensitive.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="version_1.2.2">1.2.2: Thu Mar 13, 2003</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
1.2.1 contained a boneheaded addition which prevented SmartyPants from
compiling under Perl 5.005. This has been remedied, and is the only
change from 1.2.1.
</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="version_1.2.1">1.2.1: Tue Mar 11, 2003</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
New &#8220;stupefy mode&#8221; for smarty_pants attribute. If you set
</p>

<p>
<code>smarty_pants="-1"</code>
</p>

<p>
SmartyPants will perform reverse transformations, turning HTML entities
into plain ASCII equivalents. E.g. &#8220;&#8220;&#8221; is turned into a simple
double-quote (&#8220;), &#8220;&#8212;&#8221; is turned into two dashes, etc. This is useful
if you are using SmartyPants from Brad Choate&#8217;s MT-Textile text filter,
but wish to suppress smart punctuation in specific MT templates, such as
RSS feeds. Text filters do their work before templates are processed; but
you can use smarty_pants=&#8221;-1&#8221; to reverse the transformations in specific
templates.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Replaced the POSIX-style regex character class [:punct:] with an ugly
hard-coded normal character class of all punctuation; POSIX classes
require Perl 5.6 or later, but SmartyPants still supports back to 5.005.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Several small changes to allow SmartyPants to work when Blosxom is running
in static mode.
</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="version_1.2">1.2: Thu Feb 27, 2003</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
SmartyPants is now a combination plug-in, supporting both
Movable Type (2.5 or later) and Blosxom (2.0 or later).
It also works as a BBEdit text filter and standalone
command-line Perl program. Thanks to Rael Dornfest for the
initial Blosxom port (and for the excellent Blosxom plug-in
API).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
SmartyPants now accepts the following backslash escapes,
to force non-smart punctuation. It does so by transforming
the escape sequence into a decimal-encoded HTML entity: 
</p>

<pre>
Escape  Value  Character
------  -----  ---------
  \\    &#92;    \
  \"    &#34;    "
  \'    &#39;    '
  \.    &#46;    .
  \-    &#45;    -
  \`    &#96;    `

<p>
Note that this could produce different results than previous versions of
SmartyPants, if for some reason you have an entry containing
one or more of these sequences. (Thanks to Charles Wiltgen for
the suggestion.) 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Added a new option to support inverted en- and em-dash notation:
&#8220;<code>--</code>&#8221; for em-dashes, &#8220;<code>---</code>&#8221; for en-dashes. This is
compatible with SmartyPants&#8217; original &#8220;<code>--</code>&#8221; syntax for
em-dashes, but also allows you to specify en-dashes. It can be invoked by
using <code>smart_dashes="3"</code>, <code>smarty_pants="3"</code>, or
<code>smarty_pants="i"</code>. (Suggested by Aaron Swartz.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Added a new option to automatically convert <code>&amp;quot;</code> entities
into regular double-quotes before educating quotes. This is mainly for the
benefit of people who write posts using Dreamweaver, which substitutes
this entity for any literal quote char. The one and only way to invoke
this option is to use the letter shortcuts for the <code>smarty_pants</code> attribute;
the shortcut for this option is &#8220;w&#8221; (for Dream_w_eaver). (Suggested by
Jonathon Delacour.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Added <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to the list of tags in which SmartyPants doesn&#8217;t touch the contents.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Fixed a very subtle bug that would occur if a quote was the very
last character in a body of text, preceded immediately by a tag.
Lacking any context, previous versions of SmartyPants would turn
this into an opening quote mark. It&#8217;s now correctly turned into
a closing one.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Opening quotes were being curled the wrong way when the
subsequent character was punctuation. E.g.: &#8220;<code>a '.foo' file</code>&#8221;.
Fixed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
New MT global template tag: <code>&lt;$MTSmartyPantsVersion$&gt;</code>.
Prints the version number of SmartyPants, e.g. &#8220;1.2&#8221;.
</p>
</li>


</ul>


<h3 id="version_1.1">1.1: Wed Feb 5, 2003</h3>    

<ul>

<li>
<p>
The <code>smart_dashes</code> template attribute now offers an option to use &#8220;&#45;&#45;&#8221; for <em>en</em> dashes, and &#8220;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#8221; for <em>em</em> dashes.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The default <code>smart_dashes</code> behavior now simply translates &#8220;&#8212;&#8221; (dash dash) into an em-dash. Previously, it would look for &#8220; &#8212; &#8221; (space dash dash space), which was dumb, since many people do not use spaces around their em dashes.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Using the <code>smarty_pants</code> attribute with a value of &#8220;2&#8221; will do the same thing as <code>smarty_pants="1"</code>, with one difference: it will use the new shortcuts for en- and em-dashes.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Closing quotes (single and double) were incorrectly curled in situations like this:
</p>
<p>
<code>&quot;&lt;a&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,</code>
</p>
<p>
where the comma could be just about any punctuation character. Fixed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Added <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> to the list of tags in which text shouldn&#8217;t be educated.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
