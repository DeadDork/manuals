while under the employ of the 14-year old search giant, their
surviving spouse or domestic partner will receive a check for 50%

surprising, a Google spokesperson confirms that there’s “no

<p>In a nut, App.net is a startup aiming to build a rival platform to Twitter, &#8220;where users and developers come first, not advertisers.&#8221; How? By generating revenue from users instead of from advertisers. They&#8217;re not using Kickstarter but they&#8217;ve built their own Kickstarter-like system.</p>

<p>Alas, they&#8217;re five days away from the deadline and only 45 percent of the way to their goal.

<p>Matt Brian, reporting for The Next Web:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HP believes that its earnings-per-share will rise to $1.00 in its
third fiscal quarter, up from previous estimates of $0.94, but
will exclude the hefty $8 billion impairment charge that it
expects to record in the same period.</p>

<p>The $8 billion charge has been derived from an overview of HP’s
stock, taking in market conditions and business trends in its
Services segment. This basically means after it assessed and
tested the value of its assets (or goodwill), it has determined
that its Services business may be overvalued. As a result, it has
to issue an impairment charge on its balance sheet to take into
account the reduced value of its goodwill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what this actually means.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few readers emailed to explain that what this means is that HP overpaid by $8 billion on acquisitions to build its Services division &#8212; presumably at least in part <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/hp-raises-forecast-sees-8-billion-impairment-charge.html">the $13 billion HP paid for EDS in 2008</a>.

<p>John Paczkowski:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of its case against Samsung, Apple has shown snippets of
an internal Samsung document comparing the original Galaxy S phone
with the iPhone. On Tuesday, Apple managed to get the whole
132-page document admitted into evidence. And it’s a doozy. The
2010 report, translated from Korean, goes feature by feature,
evaluating how Samsung’s phone stacks up against the iPhone.</p>

<p>Authored by Samsung’s product engineering team, the document
evaluates everything from the home screen to the browser to the
built in apps on both devices. In each case, it comes up with a
recommendation on what Samsung should do going forward and in most
cases its answer is simple: Make it work more like the iPhone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study was entered into evidence today in the high-stakes
patent trial between Apple and Samsung. There had been suggestions
that unhappy customers were returning Samsung&#8217;s tablet because
they originally thought they were buying an iPad, but the newly
released study reveals a different set of motivations.</p>

<p>The study, conducted last year at 30 Best Buy stores in New
York, Los Angeles, and Florida to determine why consumers were
returning the tablet, found that 25 percent of the returns cited
malfunctions such as browser freezes, lack of screen
sensitivity, and poor Wi-Fi connectivity. Another 17 percent
cited issues such as screen lagging, short battery life, and
inability to sync with PCs.</p>

  <p>If one edits a document, then chooses Save As, then BOTH the
edited original document <em>and</em> the copy are saved, thus not only
saving a new copy, but <em>silently saving the original with the same
changes, thus overwriting the original</em>.</p>

<p>If you notice this auto-whack, you can “Revert To” the older
version (manually), but if you don’t notice, then at some later
date you’ll be in for a confusing surprise. And maybe an
OMG-what-happened (consider a customer invoice that was

<p>Matt Neuburg points out this change in his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/07/neuburg-mountain-lion-documents">aforelinked</a> examination of <a href="http://tidbits.com/article/13187">document-model changes in Mountain Lion</a>, but it deserves attention in and of itself. I&#8217;m hoping this is a bug or oversight in 10.8.0, because I honestly can&#8217;t see why anyone would want Save As to work this way.</p>

<p>With nearly all of these changes in 10.7 and 10.8 regarding documents and saving, it&#8217;s easy to see the tradeoffs involved. Maybe <em>you</em> prefer the old way, but you can see how other users (especially new Mac users) might benefit from the new way. But with this change to Save As, I can&#8217;t see how anyone benefits.</p>

  <p>In the recently released OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, Apple has done
something I thought they’d never do: they backtracked &#8212; sort of.
They heeded the objections of users to a major feature of Mac OS X
10.7 Lion, and took steps to meet those objections. They didn’t
remove the feature &#8212; that, I suppose, would be asking too much &#8212;
but they changed the interface and provided an increased range of
user choices and capabilities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon’s system is partially at fault, but the weakest link by far
is Apple. It’s appalling that they will give control of your
iCloud account to anyone who knows your name and address, which
are very easy for anyone to find, and the last four digits of your
credit card, which are usually considered safe to display on
websites and receipts.</p>

<p>At the bare minimum, for this level of recovery that bypasses
security questions, they should require confirmation of the entire
credit-card number and verification code, no matter what they need
to do to remain PCI-compliant and pull that off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple needs to address this, and quickly. I can only wonder how many nogoodniks have been trying this scam in the last day now that it&#8217;s been widely publicized.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should point out that I disagree with Marco, though, about Apple requiring more credit card digits. This whole strategy of verification is fundamentally flawed. I wouldn&#8217;t write my iCloud password on a piece of paper in my wallet, but my wallet contains my home address and credit cards. Someone who finds my wallet should not be able to take over my iCloud account with nothing more than my driver&#8217;s license and credit card.</p>

that Apple is doing itself more harm than good in suing Samsung.</p>

<p>“By showing the public how it designs products that twice
radically changed the electronics industry, Apple could risk
losing some of its magic,” said Bilton.</p>

<p>I’m not going to say that Apple doesn’t care at all about keeping
its secrets, but this is a case of dealing with the lesser of two
evils. Sue Samsung now and show some old prototype photos but
stop them from copying future products, or let them continue
copying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. The lawsuit is about Samsung&#8217;s actions over the past few years, but Apple&#8217;s goal is about what Samsung and other like-minded competitors will do over the next few years. The stakes are far higher than the $2+ billion Apple is seeking in damages.</p>

would be “negative for the worldwide ecosystem” in computing. He

<blockquote>
  <p>In Curiosity’s case, the CPU is a PowerPC 750 (PowerPC G3 in Mac
nomenclature) clocked at around 200MHz &#8212; which might seem slow,
but it’s still hundreds of times faster than, say, the Apollo
Guidance Computer used in the first Moon landings. Also on the
motherboard are 256MB of DRAM, and 2GB of flash storage &#8212; which
will be used to store video and scientific data before
transmission to Earth. […]</p>

<p>On the software side of things, NASA again stuck to
tried-and-tested solutions, opting for the 27-year-old VxWorks
operating system. VxWorks, developed by Wind River Systems (which
was acquired by Intel), is a real-time operating system used in a
huge number of embedded systems. The previous Mars rovers
(Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and
the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft all use VxWorks. VxWorks also powers
BMW iDrive, the Apache Longbow helicopter, and the Apple Airport
Extreme and Linksys WRT54G routers (really).</p>

  <p>It’s a memo that Samsung didn’t want admitted into the trial, and
until now had kept it out. But this morning, when Samsung legal
counsel John Quinn mentioned the “crisis of design” moment in a
question to Samsung strategist Justin Denison, all bets were off,
and the memo was in.</p>

<p>“Influential figures outside the company come across the iPhone,
and they point out that ‘Samsung is dozing off.’ All this time
we’ve been paying all our attention to Nokia, and concentrated our
efforts on things like Folder, Bar, Slide,” Shin wrote. “Yet when
our UX is compared to the unexpected competitor Apple’s iPhone,
the difference is truly that of Heaven and Earth. It’s a crisis of
design.”</p>

  <p>But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several

tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon
tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information
&#8212; a partial credit card number &#8212; that Apple used to release
information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers
unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are
precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to

<p>Jason Grigsby, using data from Akamai, posits that the disparity in web browser usage between iOS and Android is almost entirely Wi-Fi traffic, and that the two are neck-and-neck on cellular networks. Fascinating, if accurate.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A bunch of readers emailed to suggest the following explanation: there are a lot of iPod Touches and even more Wi-Fi-only iPads in active use, and there are very few Wi-Fi-only Android devices. Thus, iOS accounts for way more Wi-Fi traffic than Android.</p>

<p>Another explanation for the enormous gap between &#8220;smartphone marketshare&#8221; and &#8220;mobile OS web usage share&#8221; numbers: tablets. The iPad is enormously popular for web browsing; Android tablets not so much.</p>

<p>Mobile Safari&#8217;s lead over Android continues to grow in terms of mobile web browser market share &#8212; well over three times higher according to NetMarketshare&#8217;s numbers, 66 to 19 percent. Compare that with <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/8/comScore_Reports_June_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">these new ComScore numbers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Android continued to grow its share in the U.S. smartphone
market, accounting for 51.6 percent of smartphone subscribers,
while Apple captured 32.4 percent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure how to square the disparity here other than to assume that an awful lot of Android smartphones don&#8217;t really get used as smartphones.</p>
