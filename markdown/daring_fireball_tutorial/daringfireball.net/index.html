<blockquote>
  <p>HP believes that its earnings-per-share will rise to $1.00 in its
third fiscal quarter, up from previous estimates of $0.94, but
will exclude the hefty $8 billion impairment charge that it
expects to record in the same period.</p>

<p>The $8 billion charge has been derived from an overview of HP’s
stock, taking in market conditions and business trends in its
Services segment. This basically means after it assessed and
tested the value of its assets (or goodwill), it has determined
that its Services business may be overvalued. As a result, it has
to issue an impairment charge on its balance sheet to take into
account the reduced value of its goodwill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what this actually means.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few readers emailed to explain that what this means is that HP overpaid by $8 billion on acquisitions to build its Services division &#8212; presumably at least in part <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/hp-raises-forecast-sees-8-billion-impairment-charge.html">the $13 billion HP paid for EDS in 2008</a>.

  <p>As part of its case against Samsung, Apple has shown snippets of
an internal Samsung document comparing the original Galaxy S phone
with the iPhone. On Tuesday, Apple managed to get the whole
132-page document admitted into evidence. And it’s a doozy. The
2010 report, translated from Korean, goes feature by feature,
evaluating how Samsung’s phone stacks up against the iPhone.</p>

<p>Authored by Samsung’s product engineering team, the document
evaluates everything from the home screen to the browser to the
built in apps on both devices. In each case, it comes up with a
recommendation on what Samsung should do going forward and in most
cases its answer is simple: Make it work more like the iPhone.</p>

  <p>The study was entered into evidence today in the high-stakes
patent trial between Apple and Samsung. There had been suggestions
that unhappy customers were returning Samsung&#8217;s tablet because
they originally thought they were buying an iPad, but the newly
released study reveals a different set of motivations.</p>

<p>The study, conducted last year at 30 Best Buy stores in New
York, Los Angeles, and Florida to determine why consumers were
returning the tablet, found that 25 percent of the returns cited
malfunctions such as browser freezes, lack of screen
sensitivity, and poor Wi-Fi connectivity. Another 17 percent
cited issues such as screen lagging, short battery life, and
inability to sync with PCs.</p>

I&#8217;m hoping this is a bug or oversight in 10.8.0, because I honestly can&#8217;t see why anyone would want Save As to work this way.</p>

<p>With nearly all of these changes in 10.7 and 10.8 regarding documents and saving, it&#8217;s easy to see the tradeoffs involved. Maybe <em>you</em> prefer the old way, but you can see how other users (especially new Mac users) might benefit from the new way. But with this change to Save As, I can&#8217;t see how anyone benefits.</p>

  <p>In the recently released OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, Apple has done
something I thought they’d never do: they backtracked &#8212; sort of.
They heeded the objections of users to a major feature of Mac OS X
10.7 Lion, and took steps to meet those objections. They didn’t
remove the feature &#8212; that, I suppose, would be asking too much &#8212;
but they changed the interface and provided an increased range of
user choices and capabilities.</p>

  <p>Amazon’s system is partially at fault, but the weakest link by far
is Apple. It’s appalling that they will give control of your
iCloud account to anyone who knows your name and address, which
are very easy for anyone to find, and the last four digits of your
credit card, which are usually considered safe to display on
websites and receipts.</p>

<p>At the bare minimum, for this level of recovery that bypasses
security questions, they should require confirmation of the entire
credit-card number and verification code, no matter what they need
to do to remain PCI-compliant and pull that off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple needs to address this, and quickly. I can only wonder how many nogoodniks have been trying this scam in the last day now that it&#8217;s been widely publicized.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should point out that I disagree with Marco, though, about Apple requiring more credit card digits. This whole strategy of verification is fundamentally flawed. I wouldn&#8217;t write my iCloud password on a piece of paper in my wallet, but my wallet contains my home address and credit cards. Someone who finds my wallet should not be able to take over my iCloud account with nothing more than my driver&#8217;s license and credit card.</p>

that Apple is doing itself more harm than good in suing Samsung.</p>

<p>“By showing the public how it designs products that twice
radically changed the electronics industry, Apple could risk
losing some of its magic,” said Bilton.</p>

<p>I’m not going to say that Apple doesn’t care at all about keeping
its secrets, but this is a case of dealing with the lesser of two
evils. Sue Samsung now and show some old prototype photos but
stop them from copying future products, or let them continue
copying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. The lawsuit is about Samsung&#8217;s actions over the past few years, but Apple&#8217;s goal is about what Samsung and other like-minded competitors will do over the next few years. The stakes are far higher than the $2+ billion Apple is seeking in damages.</p>

competition with his company’s Iconia or HP’s TouchPad tablets
would be “negative for the worldwide ecosystem” in computing. He
is the first head of a big PC maker to criticise Microsoft’s move
publicly.</p>

<p>“We have said [to Microsoft] think it over,” he told the Financial
Times. “Think twice. It will create a huge negative impact for the
ecosystem and other brands may take a negative reaction. It is not
something you are good at so please think twice.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Curiosity’s case, the CPU is a PowerPC 750 (PowerPC G3 in Mac
nomenclature) clocked at around 200MHz &#8212; which might seem slow,
but it’s still hundreds of times faster than, say, the Apollo
Guidance Computer used in the first Moon landings. Also on the
motherboard are 256MB of DRAM, and 2GB of flash storage &#8212; which
will be used to store video and scientific data before
transmission to Earth. […]</p>

<p>On the software side of things, NASA again stuck to
tried-and-tested solutions, opting for the 27-year-old VxWorks
operating system. VxWorks, developed by Wind River Systems (which
was acquired by Intel), is a real-time operating system used in a
huge number of embedded systems. The previous Mars rovers
(Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and
the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft all use VxWorks. VxWorks also powers
BMW iDrive, the Apache Longbow helicopter, and the Apple Airport
Extreme and Linksys WRT54G routers (really).</p>

<p>Fascinating, really, that these specs seem so humble &#8212; especially storage capacity.</p>

  <p>It’s a memo that Samsung didn’t want admitted into the trial, and
until now had kept it out. But this morning, when Samsung legal
counsel John Quinn mentioned the “crisis of design” moment in a
question to Samsung strategist Justin Denison, all bets were off,
and the memo was in.</p>

<p>“Influential figures outside the company come across the iPhone,
and they point out that ‘Samsung is dozing off.’ All this time
we’ve been paying all our attention to Nokia, and concentrated our
efforts on things like Folder, Bar, Slide,” Shin wrote. “Yet when
our UX is compared to the unexpected competitor Apple’s iPhone,
the difference is truly that of Heaven and Earth. It’s a crisis of
design.”</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know. No one (outside Google and Apple) knows what the previous licensing terms were, and no one knows what terms (if any) were proposed going forward.

  <p>But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several

tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon
tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information
&#8212; a partial credit card number &#8212; that Apple used to release
information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers
unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are
precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to

  <p>This isn’t speculation &#8212; an Apple employee copied Sony’s
design, circulated it to his bosses, and <em>testified to these
facts in court</em>.</p>

<p>From now on, when anyone heaps phrase on Apple’s design excellence
and superlative innovation, just point and laugh. Some of us have
been saying for years that what Apple is really good at is ripping
off other peoples’ ideas and stealing the credit for them with
slick marketing. This, right here, is the proof.</p>

<p>This whole &#8220;iPhone design inspired by Sony&#8221; (or, as <a href="http://www.muktware.com/4029/apple-stole-iphone-design-sony-patented-it-and-sued-everyone-else">these guys put it</a>, &#8220;Apple Stole iPhone Design From Sony, Patented It And Sued Everyone Else&#8221;) argument from Samsung has a lot of people confused.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant portion from <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1257891/Samsung_unredacted_trial_brief.pdf">Samsung&#8217;s pre-trial brief</a> (PDF):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For its part, Apple&#8217;s &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; iPhone design was derived
from the designs of a competitor &#8212; Sony. In February 2006, before
the claimed iPhone design was conceived of, Apple executive Tony
Fadell circulated a news article to Steve Jobs, Jonathan Ive and
others. In the article, a Sony designer discussed Sony designs for
portable electronic devices that lacked buttons and other
&#8220;excessive ornamentation,&#8221; fit in the hand, were &#8220;square with a
screen&#8221; and had &#8220;corners [which] have been rounded out.&#8221; Right
after this article was circulated internally, Apple industrial
designer Shin Nishibori was directed to prepare a &#8220;Sony-like&#8221;
design for an Apple phone and then had CAD drawings and a
three-dimensional model prepared. Confirming the origin of the
design, these internal Apple CAD drawings prepared at Mr.
Nishibori‘s direction even had the &#8220;Sony&#8221; name prominently
emblazoned on the phone design, as the below images from Apple‘s
internal documents show:</p>

<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/mountain_lion" title="Permanent link to ‘Mountain Lion’">Mountain Lion</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday, 25 July 2012</h6>

<p>It seems like another era, but back in the &#8217;00s, major new-cat-name updates of Mac OS X were a big deal. They were packed with major new features, new built-in apps, significant performance improvements, and often sported refreshed system-wide UI appearances (the long slow fading out of the 10.0 horizontal stripes; the meteoric rise and ignominious demise of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:daringfireball.net+anthropomorphized+brushed+metal">our old friend Brushed Metal</a>). We waited in line at Apple Stores to buy them.</p>

<p>They were extravaganzas, and they were priced accordingly at $129. Enthusiasts paid, but many on the consumer side of the Mac market waited until they replaced their machines to get on board with major new versions of the OS.</p>

<p>This changed in 2009 with Snow Leopard, which Apple touted not for its new features or visible changes, but for its under-the-hood improvements. Snow Leopard was, technically and performance-wise, a rousing success, but Apple wisely didn&#8217;t try charging the usual $129, instead pricing it at just $29. It was a wise and practical decision, marketing implications be damned, to devote over a year of engineering effort to under-the-hood OS infrastructure. A solid technical foundation is good for everyone &#8212; users, Apple, developers alike. But it&#8217;s a hard sell &#8212; like opening a restaurant that serves nutritious entrees but no desserts. It worked though. Users and critics alike deservedly praised Snow Leopard.</p>

<p>Last year with Lion, Apple added a slew of new features to the OS &#8212; some of them highly visible, such as Launchpad and Mission Control &#8212; but kept the price at $29. The biggest change was distributing the Lion installer through the App Store. The result: record-breaking adoption. Apple claims 40 percent of Macs were running Lion within 9 months of its release. That&#8217;s low by iOS standards &#8212; and keep in mind iOS updates are <em>free</em> &#8212; but very high in the context of desktop computing history. Apple claims it took Windows 7 26 months &#8212; three times longer &#8212; to reach 40 percent of the PC installed base, and Windows 7 is the most popular and highly-touted version of Windows in over a decade.</p>

<p>Now, a year later, we&#8217;ve got Mountain Lion, and it brings the upgrade cost ever lower to $19.99. That&#8217;s great. It encourages users to get on board with the latest and greatest, and I expect the result of this pricing (and the ease of doing so through the App Store) will be a record-breaking (which is to say, faster than Lion) adoption rate.</p>

<p>But what exactly do users get for their twenty bucks? In short: a nicer, more polished version of Lion. There&#8217;s definitely new stuff: iCloud document storage (more on that in a bit), Messages (which is more than just a renamed version of iChat &#8212; it supports iMessage), Notification Center (which I really like on the Mac; it&#8217;s perhaps the feature I&#8217;ve missed the most over the last few months testing the Mountain Lion betas when going back to my main machine running Lion). More back-to-the-Mac stuff from iOS, like standalone apps for Notes and Reminders, and convenient system-wide &#8220;share sheets&#8221; for sending content via email or messages and to websites like Flickr, Twitter, Vimeo, and soon, Facebook. (Facebook integration is not included in OS X 10.8; Apple says it will come in a software update &#8220;this fall&#8221;.) AirPlay Mirroring is a gem of a feature &#8212; a shining example of Apple&#8217;s &#8220;all our stuff works together seamlessly&#8221; philosophy. The new voice dictation feature is accurate, simple, and convenient &#8212; a huge accessibility win for anyone who has trouble typing.</p>

<p>But Mountain Lion isn&#8217;t billed as a blockbuster release, and it isn&#8217;t priced like one. It&#8217;s just nicer. And it&#8217;s the little things, the attention to detail, that show it best. I&#8217;ve spent most of my time testing Mountain Lion on a 2010 11-inch MacBook Air. I&#8217;ve noticed that wake-from-sleep times have gotten faster over the course of the beta period. And the MacBook Air woke from sleep just fine on Lion, by the historical standards of Apple notebooks waking from sleep. But &#8220;faster&#8221; isn&#8217;t fast enough, and the Air now feels like it&#8217;s getting pretty close to the instant-on wake-from-sleep feel of an iOS device.</p>

<p>Even the Finder has gotten some love. Copy a big folder or file and the progress bar <a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/2012/07/folder-progress.png">is drawn right on top of the folder or file&#8217;s icon</a>. Contextual information right where it&#8217;s most applicable. Some engineer spent time making copying files in the Finder a more pleasing experience.</p>

<p>But to understand what Mountain Lion really is, you really need to look at it not as a standalone OS release, but as a step in a series of releases. Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion &#8212; none of these have been radical releases of Mac OS X.<sup id="fnr1-2012-07-25"><a href="index.html#fn1-2012-07-25">1</a></sup> But taken together, there <em>have</em> been some radical changes to the Mac experience over the last five years: the App Store, sandboxing, and iCloud to name a few. Apple has introduced these features incrementally, which I think has been a win for them engineering-wise, allowing them to roll features out annually rather than queue them all up for one blockbuster major OS release. But it&#8217;s also been a win for users, introducing significant changes at a relatively gradual pace.</p>

<p>Take iCloud documents in the cloud. Use Mountain Lion and its built-in apps like TextEdit and Preview for a few hours and it is very clear that this is how Apple wants users to deal with documents and app content. It&#8217;s a radical change from the nearly 30-year-old file-system-centric approach to data management on the Mac. The old way: go to the Finder, find the file you want, and open it. The new way: go to the app and open the document from within the app. Conceptually it works just like iOS &#8212; your files aren&#8217;t in the file system, but rather &#8220;in&#8221; the app you used to create them. This is the future, but Apple isn&#8217;t forcing it upon us. The feature is prominent, yes, because Apple wants us to use it. But it is far from mandatory. Don&#8217;t want to use iCloud document storage? Then just keep on managing your files exactly as before. Apple&#8217;s not dragging us to the future; they&#8217;re enticing us to walk there on our own.</p>

<p>(Other things to note about iCloud documents: drag and drop works as you&#8217;d expect. So, yes, if you create a text file using TextEdit, it&#8217;s &#8220;in&#8221; TextEdit conceptually. But when you see it in TextEdit&#8217;s iCloud document picker window, you can just drag it out and drop it on another app, and the file will open just fine. Or you can drag it to your desktop or a Finder window. Behind the scenes an iCloud document is really just a file on your Mac with a path like <em>~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~TextEdit/Documents/Foo.txt</em>. I expected this to feel like a bigger change than it does. Instead it just feels like a simple default folder for each app&#8217;s files. I find myself saving fewer scratch documents to my desktop. I&#8217;ve always saved files to the desktop when I didn&#8217;t want to bother thinking about where they should go. Now, with iCloud documents, it&#8217;s like each (iCloud-supporting) app has its own private desktop.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Mountain Lion, and the incremental approach Apple has taken with recent OS X updates, highlights the growing schism between Apple&#8217;s and Microsoft&#8217;s philosophies. Windows 8, in contrast to Mountain Lion, <em>is</em> a radical update &#8212; years in the works and it introduces a slew of truly disruptive changes to the user experience. Mountain Lion and iOS 6 certainly share a slew of features and code, and through iCloud are growing to support a single cross-device experience. But they are very much two different and distinct systems, one for traditional keyboard and pointer device personal computers, and another for touchscreen mobile devices. One for trucks, one for cars, to borrow Steve Jobs&#8217;s analogy.</p>

<p>Microsoft, on the other hand, is clearly betting everything on their single OS strategy. We&#8217;ll see how that goes. But in terms of their traditional blockbuster &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s taken us a few years but here&#8217;s something totally new and different</em>&#8221; approach to major OS releases, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s sustainable. Windows 8 might be the last. How else can they compete with the iPad but than to switch to an Apple-style schedule of annual incremental updates?</p>

<p>That mindset and development schedule &#8212; &#8220;<em>What can we do to make this nicer by next year?</em>&#8221; &#8212; may well be the most important thing from iOS that Apple has taken back to the Mac.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Mountain Lion’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/mountain_lion">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>You could argue, perhaps, that the one and only truly radical version of Mac OS X was 10.0 in 2001.

<h2>We&#8217;re Talking About a Smaller iPad, Not a Bigger iPod Touch</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen a <a href="http://www.harbinger.me/posts/57">fair</a> <a href="http://natebarham.com/post/26633225411/7-inch-ipod-for-games">bit</a> of speculation that, if Apple produces a 7-inch iOS device, then maybe it would be a bigger iPod Touch, not a smaller iPad. One aspect of this line of thinking is that rather than making on-screen tap targets smaller (and, the worry goes, perhaps too small), a bigger iPod Touch would make tap targets bigger.</p>

<p>Whatever the merits of that idea (and I don&#8217;t think it has many), that&#8217;s not what Apple is doing. For one thing, the rumored device has a very specific screen size: 7.85 inches diagonally, 1024&#8201;&#215;&#8201;768 pixels. That&#8217;s far closer to 8 inches than 7. In fact, it&#8217;s closer to 8 inches than the 9.7-inch iPad-as-we-know-it is to 10 inches &#8212; so if you want to round to the nearest integer, it would be more accurate to call it an 8-inch iPad than a 7-inch one. Plus, the aspect ratio matches the iPad, not the iPhone/iPod Touch.</p>

<p>For another thing, I <a href="http://www.imore.com/ipad-mini/">and others</a> have heard from Cupertino-area little birdies that what Apple has been working on in the lab is a smaller iPad, not a bigger iPod. Same goes for last week&#8217;s reports <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-03/here-comes-nexus-7-nightmare-the-ipad-mini.html">from Bloomberg</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120704-703673.html">the WSJ</a>.</p>

<p>Marketing-wise, who knows what Apple would call it. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d use the &#8220;iPod&#8221; brand instead of the &#8220;iPad&#8221; brand, but anything is possible when it comes to Apple and naming products. But in terms of understanding what it is, if it ships, it&#8217;s an iPad, about two inches smaller diagonally.</p>

<h2>Poor Man&#8217;s iPad Mini Simulator</h2>

<p>A few months ago, when these 7.85-inch iPad rumors started heating up and speculation began on whether it would actually be feasible, usability-wise, to run existing iPad apps on such a display, my pal <a href="http://furbo.org/">Craig Hockenberry</a> showed me a simple trick.</p>

<p>Ends up a 7.85-inch iPad display would be about as tall, physically, as the current 9.7-inch iPad display is wide. Here&#8217;s the math: 1024 pixels divided by 163 pixels per inch = 6.28 inches for the purported iPad Mini height; 768 pixels divided by 132 pixels per inch = 5.8 inches for the current iPad width. Not exact but close &#8212; the rumored iPad Mini would actually be half an inch taller than the existing iPad is wide.</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s how you can make a poor man&#8217;s iPad Mini simulator: take a screenshot on your iPad, then view the screenshot on the iPad but rotate the device. This shrinks the screenshot to fit &#8212; almost exactly the same reduction in size as this purported iPad Mini.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not exact, but it&#8217;s a close enough approximation to see that it&#8217;s not outlandish, and that the tap targets in most apps will be just fine. I think there&#8217;s a method to Apple&#8217;s madness <a href="http://castirony.com/post/26466421254/the-case-for-a-7-8-ipad">in recommending 44-point-or-larger tap targets for all iOS apps</a>, both on the iPhone and iPad, despite the fact that on the iPad-as-we-know-it, each point is physically larger than a point on the iPhone or iPod Touch. (1 point maps directly to 1 pixel on iPad 1/2 and older iPhones; 1 point maps to a 4-pixel square on the iPad 3 and iPhone 4/4S.) A 44-point tap target on the rumored iPad Mini would be <em>exactly</em> the same physical size as a 44-point tap target on the iPhone.<sup id="fnr1-2012-07-09"><a href="index.html#fn1-2012-07-09">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This is a classic Fitts&#8217;s Law problem, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law">Fitts&#8217;s Law states</a> that the ease of hitting a target is a function of both the size of the target <em>and</em> the distance to get there. So you want bigger targets on bigger displays, because there&#8217;s more distance for your pointer (in this case, your finger) to travel, but you can get away with smaller targets on a smaller display because there&#8217;s less distance to travel.</p>

<h2>The Tweener Situation</h2>

<p>I am <em>not</em> trying to review a device that I not only haven&#8217;t seen, but which I don&#8217;t even know will ever actually ship. Maybe Apple ships this thing and it&#8217;s terrible, everything is too hard to tap and too small to read. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just saying, if you look at the math and play around with rotated iPad screenshots to reduce their size, it seems like it <em>could</em> work, even if it&#8217;s not ideal.</p>

<p>But: is not <em>ideal</em> exactly what Apple always shoots for? Has not it been a bedrock of iOS evangelism for five years that the platform offers a superior experience because developers and UI designers can target not just a physical size or pixel size but <em>both</em>, simultaneously? Would not this purported iPad Mini that runs existing iPad apps at the same pixel-count but reduced in size break from this pursuit of perfection?</p>

<p>I turn the mic over to the world&#8217;s most-quoted critic of smaller touchscreen tablets, Steven P. Jobs, during Apple&#8217;s October 2010 quarterly results conference call (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxoAF0Jvhqc">original audio</a>; <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1154980/jobs_transcript.html">transcript via Macworld</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70
percent of the benefits of a 10-inch screen. Unfortunately, this
is far from the truth. The screen measurements are diagonal, so
that a seven-inch screen is only 45 percent as large as iPad’s
10-inch screen. You heard me right: just 45 percent as large.</p>

<p>If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view, and draw
an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens
on these seven-inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half
of the iPad’s display. This size isn’t sufficient to create great
tablet apps, in our opinion.</p>

<p>While one could increase the resolution of the display to make up
some of the difference, it is meaningless unless your tablet also
includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers
to around one-quarter of their present size.</p>

<p>Apple has done extensive user testing on user interfaces over many
years, and we really understand this stuff. There are clear limits
of how close you can physically place elements on a touchscreen
before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one
of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum
size required to create great tablet apps.</p>

<p>Third, every tablet user is also a smartphone user. No tablet can
compete with the mobility of a smartphone. Its ease of fitting
into your pocket or purse. Its unobtrusiveness when used in a
crowd. Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone
in their pockets, giving up precious display area to fit a tablet
in their pockets is clearly the wrong trade-off.</p>

<p>The seven-inch tablets are tweeners: too big to compete with a
smartphone, and too small to compete with an iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how can we square the idea of Apple making an iPad Mini with Jobs&#8217;s remarks from just a year and a half ago? We could point out (again) that 7.85 inches is closer to 8 inches than 7, and that the exact size of the purported iPad Mini display offers 66 percent of the surface area of a 9.7-inch iPad, not 45 percent. We could point out (again) that, assuming Apple-recommended 44-point user interface tap targets on a display with 163 points per inch, it should offer tap targets of the <em>exact</em> same physical size as every iPhone made to date, thus avoiding the need for Apple to include sandpaper with the device.<sup id="fnr2-2012-07-09"><a href="index.html#fn2-2012-07-09">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We could point out that what Jobs was trashing on that call wasn&#8217;t so much smaller tablets in general as the specific actual smaller tablets then entering the market &#8212; led by <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/01/samsung-galaxy-tab-review/">the Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>. The remainder of his screed after the portion quoted above was quite specific: those tablets (circa October 2010) were running versions of Android that were never meant for larger-than-phone-sized displays, the Android app landscape was anemic at the time, and, perhaps most devastating, those devices were priced as high as or higher than the iPad. The contract-free Galaxy Tab cost $600, and it cost $400 with a monthly contract &#8212; which contract cost $30 a month to start. In short, a $600 Galaxy Tab running Android 2.2 is a far cry from a $200 Nexus 7 running Android 4.1. And we know that Jobs was proven exactly right: those tablets were dead on arrival.</p>

<p>We could point out a pattern that <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/02/steve-jobs/">repeated throughout Jobs&#8217;s career</a>: Jobs saying Apple wouldn&#8217;t do <em>X</em> or that <em>X</em> was a bad idea; then, a year or two later, Jobs would unveil Apple&#8217;s take on <em>X</em> and herald it as a wholly original Apple innovation. In 2003, <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Steve_Jobs_No_Tablet_No_PDA_No_Cell_Phone_Lots_Of_iPods/">he told Walt Mossberg</a> no one would want to watch video on a tiny iPod display, that Apple had no interest in the cell phone business, and no interest in the tablet market, either, saying, &#8220;It turns out people want keyboards. [&#8230;] We look at the tablet, and we think it is going to fail.&#8221; Jobs, of course, went on to introduce the first video-playing iPod in 2005, the iPhone in 2007, and a keyboard-less tablet called the iPad in 2010. <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/the-passion-of-steve-jobs/">He told John Markoff</a> in 2008 that e-books were doomed: &#8220;It doesn’t matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is that people don’t read anymore.&#8221; Two years later he unveiled the iBookstore.</p>

<p>We could point out that Tim Cook, just over a month ago at this year&#8217;s All Things D conference, declared that the ability to change his mind was <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120529/steve-jobs-was-an-awesome-flip-flopper-says-tim-cook/">among the most important things Cook learned from Jobs</a>: &#8220;He would flip on something so fast that you would forget that he was the one taking the 180 degree polar [opposite] position the day before. I saw it daily. This is a gift, because things do change, and it takes courage to change. It takes courage to say, ‘I was wrong.’ I think he had that.”</p>

<p>We could point out all of those things, but in the end none of them matter. All that matters is whether a smaller iPad would actually be good. If Apple ships it, it will be judged on its own merits, regardless of what Steve Jobs said 18 months ago. That&#8217;s it.</p>

<h2>That the Purported Device&#8217;s Display Is, Purportedly, Not Retina</h2>

<p>Another strain of skepticism I&#8217;ve seen goes along the following lines:</p>

<p><em>It&#8217;s one thing for Apple to continue selling the iPhone 3GS and iPad 2, but I can&#8217;t see Apple introducing a new device with a non-retina display.</em></p>

<p>It does seem curious. But it <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/01/agitators">also seemed curious back</a> in January 2004 when Apple unveiled the 4 GB iPod Mini for $249, given that for just $50 more you could buy the regular iPod, which had 15 GB of storage. Trade-offs have to be made. When Apple designed the iPod Mini, they optimized for one factor: a reduction in physical size and weight. The consequences of that trade-off were that the iPod Mini wasn&#8217;t much cheaper than the regular iPod, and it had far less storage capacity.</p>

<p>If Apple were to ship a 7.85-inch iPad with a non-retina 163-ppi display, it would signify that one of the key factors they&#8217;re optimizing for is cost. Unlike that iPod Mini, which was smaller but cost almost as much as its bigger sibling, perhaps this iPad Mini is smaller and costs much less &#8212; at the expense, for one thing, of display quality. This, of course, would pave the way for a retina update a year or two down the line.</p>

<p>Which in turn suggests a way to turn this strain of skepticism on its head. Apple, to date, has never introduced a new iOS form factor with a retina display &#8212; they add retina displays as upgrades two or three years after devices hit the market.</p>

<p>And, by introducing the iPad Mini with a non-retina display but a lower price, it would instantly establish which product is the &#8220;best&#8221; (iPad (3)) and which is the low-cost model (iPad Mini). In this way, I envision the iPad/iPad Mini relationship being very different from the iPod/iPod Mini one, where the two products were nearly evenly priced and you chose between storage capacity (iPod) and device size/weight (iPod Mini).</p>

<h2>Price</h2>

<p>Speaking of price, <a href="http://tracks.ranea.org/post/26571046083/7-inch-ipad-maybe-but-199">Watts Martin doesn&#8217;t think Apple could hit the $199 mark</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple makes as much money as they do &#8212; a whole lot of money
indeed &#8212; by being strategic about what money they go after.
They’re fine with being a “premium” brand. And even as good as
their supply chain management is, I don’t think Apple can produce
a 7-inch iPad for $140.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s why I think Apple could sell it for $199. If Google can sell the 1280&#8201;&#215;&#8201;800 pixel Nexus 7 for $199 and break even on it, I think Apple could produce a 1024&#8201;&#215;&#8201;768 7.85-inch iPad for a break-even price of, say, $150. Charge $199 and that&#8217;s a decent (but, admittedly, low by Apple&#8217;s astounding standards) 25 percent margin.</p>

<p>Why do I think Apple could produce it for less than Google/Asus? Because Apple has such tremendous economy-of-scale advantages. But maybe Martin is right, and iPad Mini prices will &#8212; <em>if</em> the thing is real &#8212; start at $249. It certainly wouldn&#8217;t be outlandish for Apple to charge some sort of premium over the base price of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire (although who knows what this year&#8217;s Kindle Fire will cost &#8212; Amazon has been relentless about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/amazons_new_kindles">reducing the price of Kindle hardware year-over-year</a>).</p>

<p>But as important as profit margins are to Apple, sometimes opportunities arise that are exceptions to the rule. iPhones and iPads are not just devices. They are the foundation for what is turning into the biggest software platform since DOS/Windows, and what is already the most profitable one.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s again return to one Mr. Steven Paul Jobs, this time from his (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/25/critical-juncture.php">oft-cited</a> by yours truly) <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/03/ipod_juggernaut">2004 interview with Steven Levy</a> for Newsweek, regarding how the Mac got stuck with so little market share:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If that’s so, then why is the Mac market share, even after Apple’s
recent revival, sputtering at a measly 5 percent? Jobs has a
theory about that, too. Once a company devises a great product, he
says, it has a monopoly in that realm, and concentrates less on
innovation than protecting its turf. “The Mac user interface was a
10-year monopoly,” says Jobs. “Who ended up running the company?
<em>Sales guys.</em> At the critical juncture in the late ’80s, when they
should have gone for market share, they went for profits. They
made obscene profits for several years. And their products became
mediocre. And then their monopoly ended with Windows 95. They
behaved like a monopoly, and it came back to bite them, which
always happens.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s still all about profit. The tension is between short-term profit margins (focusing on average selling price and profit per iPad sold by ceding the market for smaller cheaper tablets to Google and Amazon) and long-term profit (from maximizing market share as soon as possible, while the post-PC market landscape remains nascent and fluid).</p>

<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10225484-37.html">Here&#8217;s Tom Krazit quoting Tim Cook back in 2009</a> (regarding the iPhone, but I think even more applicable in the tablet market):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Wednesday, Cook echoed Jobs&#8217; comments about iPhone pricing by
saying &#8220;one thing we&#8217;ll make sure is that we don&#8217;t leave a price
umbrella for people.&#8221; A price umbrella is a term used to describe
the effect a dominant company can have on a particular market with
a popular-yet-expensive product: competitors can enter the market
with other products at lower prices and gain customers just based
on affordability, buying those companies time and profits to use
in order to make their product better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple followed that strategy a decade ago with the iPod. Though the stakes are now far higher, I see no reason they wouldn&#8217;t do the same this decade with the iPad.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Let’s Try to Think This iPad Mini Thing All the Way Through’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/this_ipad_mini_thing">&#9733;</a></p>
