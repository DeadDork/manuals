<p>Meghan Casserly, for Forbes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, Bock, who joined the company in 2006 after a stint with
General Electric, blew me away by disclosing a
never-before-made-public-perk:  Should a U.S. Googler pass away
while under the employ of the 14-year old search giant, their
surviving spouse or domestic partner will receive a check for 50%
of their salary every year for the next decade. Even more
surprising, a Google spokesperson confirms that there’s “no
tenure requirement” for this benefit, meaning most of their 34
thousand Google employees qualify.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Serious kudos to Google; that&#8217;s a great benefit.</p>

<p>In a nut, App.net is a startup aiming to build a rival platform to Twitter, &#8220;where users and developers come first, not advertisers.&#8221; How? By generating revenue from users instead of from advertisers. They&#8217;re not using Kickstarter but they&#8217;ve built their own Kickstarter-like system.</p>

<p>Alas, they&#8217;re five days away from the deadline and only 45 percent of the way to their goal. If you&#8217;re dismayed by Twitter&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/11/twitter-ecosystem-guidelines/">shabby</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience">getting-shabbier</a>-by-the-<a href="http://dcurt.is/twitter-war">month</a> treatment of third-party developers and the ever-increasing mass-market promotional detritus littering Twitter&#8217;s first-party interfaces, I really encourage you to get on board as an App.net backer. <a href="http://alpha.app.net/gruber">I did</a>, and I&#8217;m already liking <a href="https://alpha.app.net/gruber/post/8582">what I&#8217;m seeing</a> in the alpha release.</p>

<p>Matt Brian, reporting for The Next Web:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HP believes that its earnings-per-share will rise to $1.00 in its
third fiscal quarter, up from previous estimates of $0.94, but
will exclude the hefty $8 billion impairment charge that it
expects to record in the same period.</p>

<p>The $8 billion charge has been derived from an overview of HP’s
stock, taking in market conditions and business trends in its
Services segment. This basically means after it assessed and
tested the value of its assets (or goodwill), it has determined
that its Services business may be overvalued. As a result, it has
to issue an impairment charge on its balance sheet to take into
account the reduced value of its goodwill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what this actually means.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few readers emailed to explain that what this means is that HP overpaid by $8 billion on acquisitions to build its Services division &#8212; presumably at least in part <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/hp-raises-forecast-sees-8-billion-impairment-charge.html">the $13 billion HP paid for EDS in 2008</a>. Keep that in mind next time you see someone draw up <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/suggestions-for-an-apple-shopping-list/">a list</a> of expensive acquisitions for Apple to expend its cash hoard upon.</p>

<p>John Paczkowski:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of its case against Samsung, Apple has shown snippets of
an internal Samsung document comparing the original Galaxy S phone
with the iPhone. On Tuesday, Apple managed to get the whole
132-page document admitted into evidence. And it’s a doozy. The
2010 report, translated from Korean, goes feature by feature,
evaluating how Samsung’s phone stacks up against the iPhone.</p>

<p>Authored by Samsung’s product engineering team, the document
evaluates everything from the home screen to the browser to the
built in apps on both devices. In each case, it comes up with a
recommendation on what Samsung should do going forward and in most
cases its answer is simple: Make it work more like the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paczkowski uploaded <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/102317767/44">the whole thing to Scribd</a>. You really have to read it to believe just how audacious it is.</p>

<p>Steven Musil, reporting for CNet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study was entered into evidence today in the high-stakes
patent trial between Apple and Samsung. There had been suggestions
that unhappy customers were returning Samsung&#8217;s tablet because
they originally thought they were buying an iPad, but the newly
released study reveals a different set of motivations.</p>

<p>The study, conducted last year at 30 Best Buy stores in New
York, Los Angeles, and Florida to determine why consumers were
returning the tablet, found that 25 percent of the returns cited
malfunctions such as browser freezes, lack of screen
sensitivity, and poor Wi-Fi connectivity. Another 17 percent
cited issues such as screen lagging, short battery life, and
inability to sync with PCs.</p>

<p>Mac Performance Guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If one edits a document, then chooses Save As, then BOTH the
edited original document <em>and</em> the copy are saved, thus not only
saving a new copy, but <em>silently saving the original with the same
changes, thus overwriting the original</em>.</p>

<p>If you notice this auto-whack, you can “Revert To” the older
version (manually), but if you don’t notice, then at some later
date you’ll be in for a confusing surprise. And maybe an
OMG-what-happened (consider a customer invoice that was
overwritten).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matt Neuburg points out this change in his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/07/neuburg-mountain-lion-documents">aforelinked</a> examination of <a href="http://tidbits.com/article/13187">document-model changes in Mountain Lion</a>, but it deserves attention in and of itself. I&#8217;m hoping this is a bug or oversight in 10.8.0, because I honestly can&#8217;t see why anyone would want Save As to work this way.</p>

<p>With nearly all of these changes in 10.7 and 10.8 regarding documents and saving, it&#8217;s easy to see the tradeoffs involved. Maybe <em>you</em> prefer the old way, but you can see how other users (especially new Mac users) might benefit from the new way. But with this change to Save As, I can&#8217;t see how anyone benefits.</p>

<p>Matt Neuburg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the recently released OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, Apple has done
something I thought they’d never do: they backtracked &#8212; sort of.
They heeded the objections of users to a major feature of Mac OS X
10.7 Lion, and took steps to meet those objections. They didn’t
remove the feature &#8212; that, I suppose, would be asking too much &#8212;
but they changed the interface and provided an increased range of
user choices and capabilities.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll sketch out how Mountain Lion is different
from Lion with regard to this feature, and why, therefore, I
personally like Mountain Lion much more than Lion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Detailed treatment of some very significant changes to document handling in Mountain Lion.</p>

<p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon’s system is partially at fault, but the weakest link by far
is Apple. It’s appalling that they will give control of your
iCloud account to anyone who knows your name and address, which
are very easy for anyone to find, and the last four digits of your
credit card, which are usually considered safe to display on
websites and receipts.</p>

<p>At the bare minimum, for this level of recovery that bypasses
security questions, they should require confirmation of the entire
credit-card number and verification code, no matter what they need
to do to remain PCI-compliant and pull that off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple needs to address this, and quickly. I can only wonder how many nogoodniks have been trying this scam in the last day now that it&#8217;s been widely publicized.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should point out that I disagree with Marco, though, about Apple requiring more credit card digits. This whole strategy of verification is fundamentally flawed. I wouldn&#8217;t write my iCloud password on a piece of paper in my wallet, but my wallet contains my home address and credit cards. Someone who finds my wallet should not be able to take over my iCloud account with nothing more than my driver&#8217;s license and credit card.</p>

<p>Jim Dalrymple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a column on <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/apple-patent-fight-with-samsung-spills-some-iphone-and-ipad-secrets-disruptions/">The New York Times</a> last weekend, Nick Bilton wrote
that Apple is doing itself more harm than good in suing Samsung.</p>

<p>“By showing the public how it designs products that twice
radically changed the electronics industry, Apple could risk
losing some of its magic,” said Bilton.</p>

<p>I’m not going to say that Apple doesn’t care at all about keeping
its secrets, but this is a case of dealing with the lesser of two
evils. Sue Samsung now and show some old prototype photos but
stop them from copying future products, or let them continue
copying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. The lawsuit is about Samsung&#8217;s actions over the past few years, but Apple&#8217;s goal is about what Samsung and other like-minded competitors will do over the next few years. The stakes are far higher than the $2+ billion Apple is seeking in damages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like Apple and Samsung have another thing in common,
aside from their love of rectangular tablet designs: alleged labor
abuses at the Chinese factories which make their products. In a
scathing undercover report issued last night, activist group China
Labor Watch detailed a litany of alleged abuses, including
employing workers as young as 14, at Samsung supplier HEG’s
factory complex in mainland China.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m sure this will get just as much media attention as Apple&#8217;s supply chain labor practices have.</p>

<p>Robert Budden and Sarah Mishkin, reporting for the Financial Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JT Wang, chairman and chief executive of Acer, said Microsoft’s
plans to launch its own “Surface” tablet in October &#8212; in direct
competition with his company’s Iconia or HP’s TouchPad tablets
would be “negative for the worldwide ecosystem” in computing. He
is the first head of a big PC maker to criticise Microsoft’s move
publicly.</p>

<p>“We have said [to Microsoft] think it over,” he told the Financial
Times. “Think twice. It will create a huge negative impact for the
ecosystem and other brands may take a negative reaction. It is not
something you are good at so please think twice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little late for that now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Campbell Kan, Acer’s president for personal computer global
operations, said the Taiwanese company was debating internally how
to respond to the Surface and any further challenges that could
arise if Microsoft expands further into hardware.</p>

<p>“If Microsoft … is going to do hardware business, what should we
do? Should we still rely on Microsoft, or should we find other
alternatives?,” Mr Kan said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the problem for Acer and all the other PC makers &#8212; <em>what alternatives</em>? Linux? No one wants it. Android? Google&#8217;s in the hardware business now too. That&#8217;s why Microsoft can make this play &#8212; the PC makers have no leverage.</p>

<p>Sebastian Anthony, writing for ExtremeTech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Curiosity’s case, the CPU is a PowerPC 750 (PowerPC G3 in Mac
nomenclature) clocked at around 200MHz &#8212; which might seem slow,
but it’s still hundreds of times faster than, say, the Apollo
Guidance Computer used in the first Moon landings. Also on the
motherboard are 256MB of DRAM, and 2GB of flash storage &#8212; which
will be used to store video and scientific data before
transmission to Earth. […]</p>

<p>On the software side of things, NASA again stuck to
tried-and-tested solutions, opting for the 27-year-old VxWorks
operating system. VxWorks, developed by Wind River Systems (which
was acquired by Intel), is a real-time operating system used in a
huge number of embedded systems. The previous Mars rovers
(Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and
the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft all use VxWorks. VxWorks also powers
BMW iDrive, the Apache Longbow helicopter, and the Apple Airport
Extreme and Linksys WRT54G routers (really).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating, really, that these specs seem so humble &#8212; especially storage capacity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a memo that Samsung didn’t want admitted into the trial, and
until now had kept it out. But this morning, when Samsung legal
counsel John Quinn mentioned the “crisis of design” moment in a
question to Samsung strategist Justin Denison, all bets were off,
and the memo was in.</p>

<p>“Influential figures outside the company come across the iPhone,
and they point out that ‘Samsung is dozing off.’ All this time
we’ve been paying all our attention to Nokia, and concentrated our
efforts on things like Folder, Bar, Slide,” Shin wrote. “Yet when
our UX is compared to the unexpected competitor Apple’s iPhone,
the difference is truly that of Heaven and Earth. It’s a crisis of
design.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what they were worried about. It&#8217;s just black rectangles.</p>

<p>Mat Honan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several
customer service systems, most notably Apple and Amazon’s. Apple
tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon
tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information
&#8212; a partial credit card number &#8212; that Apple used to release
information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers
unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are
precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to
perform identity verification. The disconnect exposes flaws in
data management policies endemic to the entire technology
industry, and points to a looming nightmare as we enter the era of
cloud computing and connected devices.</p>

<p>Kenneth Chang, reporting for the NYT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rover, called Curiosity, ushers in a new era of exploration
that could turn up evidence that the Red Planet once had the
necessary ingredients for life &#8212; or might even still harbor
life today. NASA and administration officials were also quick to
point to the success to counter criticism that the space agency
had turned into a creaky bureaucracy incapable of matching its
past glory.</p>

<p>Sebastian Anthony, writing for ExtremeTech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish I could say that Brocious spent months on this hack,
painstakingly reverse-engineering the Onity lock protocol, but the
truth is far more depressing. “With how stupidly simple this is,
it wouldn’t surprise me if a thousand other people have found this
same vulnerability and sold it to other governments,” says
Brocious, in an interview with Forbes. “An intern at the NSA could
find this in five minutes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I got a nice email from Cody Brocious, the security researcher who discovered this. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing I&#8217;d really like to clarify (which ExtremeTech still
hasn&#8217;t) is that it <em>did</em> take me months. In fact, the work I
released is the product of 3 years of reversing the entire system.
The simplicity of the result really hides the work that was done
to reach this point.</p>

<p>That said, thanks for covering this; anything that gets the word
out about the (lack of) security here is a Good Thing (TM).</p>

<p><a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4479">Eric Raymond</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn’t speculation &#8212; an Apple employee copied Sony’s
design, circulated it to his bosses, and <em>testified to these
facts in court</em>.</p>

<p>From now on, when anyone heaps phrase on Apple’s design excellence
and superlative innovation, just point and laugh. Some of us have
been saying for years that what Apple is really good at is ripping
off other peoples’ ideas and stealing the credit for them with
slick marketing. This, right here, is the proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole &#8220;iPhone design inspired by Sony&#8221; (or, as <a href="http://www.muktware.com/4029/apple-stole-iphone-design-sony-patented-it-and-sued-everyone-else">these guys put it</a>, &#8220;Apple Stole iPhone Design From Sony, Patented It And Sued Everyone Else&#8221;) argument from Samsung has a lot of people confused.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant portion from <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1257891/Samsung_unredacted_trial_brief.pdf">Samsung&#8217;s pre-trial brief</a> (PDF):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For its part, Apple&#8217;s &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; iPhone design was derived
from the designs of a competitor &#8212; Sony. In February 2006, before
the claimed iPhone design was conceived of, Apple executive Tony
Fadell circulated a news article to Steve Jobs, Jonathan Ive and
others. In the article, a Sony designer discussed Sony designs for
portable electronic devices that lacked buttons and other
&#8220;excessive ornamentation,&#8221; fit in the hand, were &#8220;square with a
screen&#8221; and had &#8220;corners [which] have been rounded out.&#8221; Right
after this article was circulated internally, Apple industrial
designer Shin Nishibori was directed to prepare a &#8220;Sony-like&#8221;
design for an Apple phone and then had CAD drawings and a
three-dimensional model prepared. Confirming the origin of the
design, these internal Apple CAD drawings prepared at Mr.
Nishibori‘s direction even had the &#8220;Sony&#8221; name prominently
emblazoned on the phone design, as the below images from Apple‘s
internal documents show:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/26/3189309/apple-sony-iphone-design-inspiration-iphone-4-looked-old">The Verge has an image gallery</a> of the &#8220;Sony&#8221; phone in question. Here&#8217;s the thing, though &#8212; it&#8217;s not a Sony phone. It&#8217;s an in-house mockup by an Apple designer inspired by a very broad <em>description</em> of Sony devices. There is no actual circa 2006 Sony phone that looks like this. [<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120726/apples-iphone-has-sony-style-says-samsung/">Here&#8217;s more on the Samsung-cited Businessweek interview</a> with two Sony designers, including the relevant passage, which was actually in response to a question about how much Sony&#8217;s design had been inspired by, of all things, the iPod.]</p>

<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120727/apple-tries-to-torpedo-samsungs-sony-style-iphone-charge/">Via John Paczkowski</a>, here&#8217;s <a href="/misc/2012/07/sony-walkman.jpg">the <em>actual</em> Sony phone Samsung is claiming Apple copied for the iPhone</a>. Yeah, that&#8217;s a dead ringer for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Feel free to continue believing what you want to believe about how original the iPhone design was (<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/30/3201162/apple-refutes-claim-they-cribbed-notes-from-sony-reveal-prototype">here&#8217;s a 2005 design by Apple</a>, another fascinating nugget revealed by this lawsuit), but don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking this &#8220;Sony&#8221; mockup was an actual Sony phone or even a Sony concept. It was an Apple concept showing what a Sony phone might look like.</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thoughts on OS X 10.8.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>It seems like another era, but back in the &#8217;00s, major new-cat-name updates of Mac OS X were a big deal. They were packed with major new features, new built-in apps, significant performance improvements, and often sported refreshed system-wide UI appearances (the long slow fading out of the 10.0 horizontal stripes; the meteoric rise and ignominious demise of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:daringfireball.net+anthropomorphized+brushed+metal">our old friend Brushed Metal</a>). We waited in line at Apple Stores to buy them.</p>

<p>They were extravaganzas, and they were priced accordingly at $129. Enthusiasts paid, but many on the consumer side of the Mac market waited until they replaced their machines to get on board with major new versions of the OS.</p>

<p>This changed in 2009 with Snow Leopard, which Apple touted not for its new features or visible changes, but for its under-the-hood improvements. Snow Leopard was, technically and performance-wise, a rousing success, but Apple wisely didn&#8217;t try charging the usual $129, instead pricing it at just $29. It was a wise and practical decision, marketing implications be damned, to devote over a year of engineering effort to under-the-hood OS infrastructure. A solid technical foundation is good for everyone &#8212; users, Apple, developers alike. But it&#8217;s a hard sell &#8212; like opening a restaurant that serves nutritious entrees but no desserts. It worked though. Users and critics alike deservedly praised Snow Leopard.</p>

<p>Last year with Lion, Apple added a slew of new features to the OS &#8212; some of them highly visible, such as Launchpad and Mission Control &#8212; but kept the price at $29. The biggest change was distributing the Lion installer through the App Store. The result: record-breaking adoption. Apple claims 40 percent of Macs were running Lion within 9 months of its release. That&#8217;s low by iOS standards &#8212; and keep in mind iOS updates are <em>free</em> &#8212; but very high in the context of desktop computing history. Apple claims it took Windows 7 26 months &#8212; three times longer &#8212; to reach 40 percent of the PC installed base, and Windows 7 is the most popular and highly-touted version of Windows in over a decade.</p>

<p>Now, a year later, we&#8217;ve got Mountain Lion, and it brings the upgrade cost ever lower to $19.99. That&#8217;s great. It encourages users to get on board with the latest and greatest, and I expect the result of this pricing (and the ease of doing so through the App Store) will be a record-breaking (which is to say, faster than Lion) adoption rate.</p>

<p>But what exactly do users get for their twenty bucks? In short: a nicer, more polished version of Lion. There&#8217;s definitely new stuff: iCloud document storage (more on that in a bit), Messages (which is more than just a renamed version of iChat &#8212; it supports iMessage), Notification Center (which I really like on the Mac; it&#8217;s perhaps the feature I&#8217;ve missed the most over the last few months testing the Mountain Lion betas when going back to my main machine running Lion). More back-to-the-Mac stuff from iOS, like standalone apps for Notes and Reminders, and convenient system-wide &#8220;share sheets&#8221; for sending content via email or messages and to websites like Flickr, Twitter, Vimeo, and soon, Facebook. (Facebook integration is not included in OS X 10.8; Apple says it will come in a software update &#8220;this fall&#8221;.) AirPlay Mirroring is a gem of a feature &#8212; a shining example of Apple&#8217;s &#8220;all our stuff works together seamlessly&#8221; philosophy. The new voice dictation feature is accurate, simple, and convenient &#8212; a huge accessibility win for anyone who has trouble typing.</p>

<p>But Mountain Lion isn&#8217;t billed as a blockbuster release, and it isn&#8217;t priced like one. It&#8217;s just nicer. And it&#8217;s the little things, the attention to detail, that show it best. I&#8217;ve spent most of my time testing Mountain Lion on a 2010 11-inch MacBook Air. I&#8217;ve noticed that wake-from-sleep times have gotten faster over the course of the beta period. And the MacBook Air woke from sleep just fine on Lion, by the historical standards of Apple notebooks waking from sleep. But &#8220;faster&#8221; isn&#8217;t fast enough, and the Air now feels like it&#8217;s getting pretty close to the instant-on wake-from-sleep feel of an iOS device.</p>

<p>Even the Finder has gotten some love. Copy a big folder or file and the progress bar <a href="/misc/2012/07/folder-progress.png">is drawn right on top of the folder or file&#8217;s icon</a>. Contextual information right where it&#8217;s most applicable. Some engineer spent time making copying files in the Finder a more pleasing experience.</p>

<p>But to understand what Mountain Lion really is, you really need to look at it not as a standalone OS release, but as a step in a series of releases. Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion &#8212; none of these have been radical releases of Mac OS X.<sup id="fnr1-2012-07-25"><a href="#fn1-2012-07-25">1</a></sup> But taken together, there <em>have</em> been some radical changes to the Mac experience over the last five years: the App Store, sandboxing, and iCloud to name a few. Apple has introduced these features incrementally, which I think has been a win for them engineering-wise, allowing them to roll features out annually rather than queue them all up for one blockbuster major OS release. But it&#8217;s also been a win for users, introducing significant changes at a relatively gradual pace.</p>

<p>Take iCloud documents in the cloud. Use Mountain Lion and its built-in apps like TextEdit and Preview for a few hours and it is very clear that this is how Apple wants users to deal with documents and app content. It&#8217;s a radical change from the nearly 30-year-old file-system-centric approach to data management on the Mac. The old way: go to the Finder, find the file you want, and open it. The new way: go to the app and open the document from within the app. Conceptually it works just like iOS &#8212; your files aren&#8217;t in the file system, but rather &#8220;in&#8221; the app you used to create them. This is the future, but Apple isn&#8217;t forcing it upon us. The feature is prominent, yes, because Apple wants us to use it. But it is far from mandatory. Don&#8217;t want to use iCloud document storage? Then just keep on managing your files exactly as before. Apple&#8217;s not dragging us to the future; they&#8217;re enticing us to walk there on our own.</p>

<p>(Other things to note about iCloud documents: drag and drop works as you&#8217;d expect. So, yes, if you create a text file using TextEdit, it&#8217;s &#8220;in&#8221; TextEdit conceptually. But when you see it in TextEdit&#8217;s iCloud document picker window, you can just drag it out and drop it on another app, and the file will open just fine. Or you can drag it to your desktop or a Finder window. Behind the scenes an iCloud document is really just a file on your Mac with a path like <em>~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~TextEdit/Documents/Foo.txt</em>. I expected this to feel like a bigger change than it does. Instead it just feels like a simple default folder for each app&#8217;s files. I find myself saving fewer scratch documents to my desktop. I&#8217;ve always saved files to the desktop when I didn&#8217;t want to bother thinking about where they should go. Now, with iCloud documents, it&#8217;s like each (iCloud-supporting) app has its own private desktop.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Mountain Lion, and the incremental approach Apple has taken with recent OS X updates, highlights the growing schism between Apple&#8217;s and Microsoft&#8217;s philosophies. Windows 8, in contrast to Mountain Lion, <em>is</em> a radical update &#8212; years in the works and it introduces a slew of truly disruptive changes to the user experience. Mountain Lion and iOS 6 certainly share a slew of features and code, and through iCloud are growing to support a single cross-device experience. But they are very much two different and distinct systems, one for traditional keyboard and pointer device personal computers, and another for touchscreen mobile devices. One for trucks, one for cars, to borrow Steve Jobs&#8217;s analogy.</p>

<p>Microsoft, on the other hand, is clearly betting everything on their single OS strategy. We&#8217;ll see how that goes. But in terms of their traditional blockbuster &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s taken us a few years but here&#8217;s something totally new and different</em>&#8221; approach to major OS releases, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s sustainable. Windows 8 might be the last. How else can they compete with the iPad but than to switch to an Apple-style schedule of annual incremental updates?</p>

<p>That mindset and development schedule &#8212; &#8220;<em>What can we do to make this nicer by next year?</em>&#8221; &#8212; may well be the most important thing from iOS that Apple has taken back to the Mac.</p>

<p>You could argue, perhaps, that the one and only truly radical version of Mac OS X was 10.0 in 2001.

<h2>We&#8217;re Talking About a Smaller iPad, Not a Bigger iPod Touch</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen a <a href="http://www.harbinger.me/posts/57">fair</a> <a href="http://natebarham.com/post/26633225411/7-inch-ipod-for-games">bit</a> of speculation that, if Apple produces a 7-inch iOS device, then maybe it would be a bigger iPod Touch, not a smaller iPad. One aspect of this line of thinking is that rather than making on-screen tap targets smaller (and, the worry goes, perhaps too small), a bigger iPod Touch would make tap targets bigger.</p>

<p>Whatever the merits of that idea (and I don&#8217;t think it has many), that&#8217;s not what Apple is doing. For one thing, the rumored device has a very specific screen size: 7.85 inches diagonally, 1024&#8201;&#215;&#8201;768 pixels. That&#8217;s far closer to 8 inches than 7. In fact, it&#8217;s closer to 8 inches than the 9.7-inch iPad-as-we-know-it is to 10 inches &#8212; so if you want to round to the nearest integer, it would be more accurate to call it an 8-inch iPad than a 7-inch one. Plus, the aspect ratio matches the iPad, not the iPhone/iPod Touch.</p>

<p>For another thing, I <a href="http://www.imore.com/ipad-mini/">and others</a> have heard from Cupertino-area little birdies that what Apple has been working on in the lab is a smaller iPad, not a bigger iPod. Same goes for last week&#8217;s reports <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-03/here-comes-nexus-7-nightmare-the-ipad-mini.html">from Bloomberg</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120704-703673.html">the WSJ</a>.</p>

<p>Marketing-wise, who knows what Apple would call it. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d use the &#8220;iPod&#8221; brand instead of the &#8220;iPad&#8221; brand, but anything is possible when it comes to Apple and naming products. But in terms of understanding what it is, if it ships, it&#8217;s an iPad, about two inches smaller diagonally.</p>

<h2>Poor Man&#8217;s iPad Mini Simulator</h2>

<p>A few months ago, when these 7.85-inch iPad rumors started heating up and speculation began on whether it would actually be feasible, usability-wise, to run existing iPad apps on such a display, my pal <a href="http://furbo.org/">Craig Hockenberry</a> showed me a simple trick.</p>

<p>Ends up a 7.85-inch iPad display would be about as tall, physically, as the current 9.7-inch iPad display is wide. Here&#8217;s the math: 1024 pixels divided by 163 pixels per inch = 6.28 inches for the purported iPad Mini height; 768 pixels divided by 132 pixels per inch = 5.8 inches for the current iPad width. Not exact but close &#8212; the rumored iPad Mini would actually be half an inch taller than the existing iPad is wide.</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s how you can make a poor man&#8217;s iPad Mini simulator: take a screenshot on your iPad, then view the screenshot on the iPad but rotate the device. This shrinks the screenshot to fit &#8212; almost exactly the same reduction in size as this purported iPad Mini.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not exact, but it&#8217;s a close enough approximation to see that it&#8217;s not outlandish, and that the tap targets in most apps will be just fine. I think there&#8217;s a method to Apple&#8217;s madness <a href="http://castirony.com/post/26466421254/the-case-for-a-7-8-ipad">in recommending 44-point-or-larger tap targets for all iOS apps</a>, both on the iPhone and iPad, despite the fact that on the iPad-as-we-know-it, each point is physically larger than a point on the iPhone or iPod Touch. (1 point maps directly to 1 pixel on iPad 1/2 and older iPhones; 1 point maps to a 4-pixel square on the iPad 3 and iPhone 4/4S.) A 44-point tap target on the rumored iPad Mini would be <em>exactly</em> the same physical size as a 44-point tap target on the iPhone.<sup id="fnr1-2012-07-09"><a href="#fn1-2012-07-09">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This is a classic Fitts&#8217;s Law problem, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law">Fitts&#8217;s Law states</a> that the ease of hitting a target is a function of both the size of the target <em>and</em> the distance to get there. So you want bigger targets on bigger displays, because there&#8217;s more distance for your pointer (in this case, your finger) to travel, but you can get away with smaller targets on a smaller display because there&#8217;s less distance to travel.</p>

<h2>The Tweener Situation</h2>

<p>I am <em>not</em> trying to review a device that I not only haven&#8217;t seen, but which I don&#8217;t even know will ever actually ship. Maybe Apple ships this thing and it&#8217;s terrible, everything is too hard to tap and too small to read. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just saying, if you look at the math and play around with rotated iPad screenshots to reduce their size, it seems like it <em>could</em> work, even if it&#8217;s not ideal.</p>

<p>But: is not <em>ideal</em> exactly what Apple always shoots for? Has not it been a bedrock of iOS evangelism for five years that the platform offers a superior experience because developers and UI designers can target not just a physical size or pixel size but <em>both</em>, simultaneously? Would not this purported iPad Mini that runs existing iPad apps at the same pixel-count but reduced in size break from this pursuit of perfection?</p>

<p>I turn the mic over to the world&#8217;s most-quoted critic of smaller touchscreen tablets, Steven P. Jobs, during Apple&#8217;s October 2010 quarterly results conference call (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxoAF0Jvhqc">original audio</a>; <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1154980/jobs_transcript.html">transcript via Macworld</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70
percent of the benefits of a 10-inch screen. Unfortunately, this
is far from the truth. The screen measurements are diagonal, so
that a seven-inch screen is only 45 percent as large as iPad’s
10-inch screen. You heard me right: just 45 percent as large.</p>

<p>If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view, and draw
an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens
on these seven-inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half
of the iPad’s display. This size isn’t sufficient to create great
tablet apps, in our opinion.</p>

<p>While one could increase the resolution of the display to make up
some of the difference, it is meaningless unless your tablet also
includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers
to around one-quarter of their present size.</p>

<p>Apple has done extensive user testing on user interfaces over many
years, and we really understand this stuff. There are clear limits
of how close you can physically place elements on a touchscreen
before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one
of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum
size required to create great tablet apps.</p>

<p>Third, every tablet user is also a smartphone user. No tablet can
compete with the mobility of a smartphone. Its ease of fitting
into your pocket or purse. Its unobtrusiveness when used in a
crowd. Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone
in their pockets, giving up precious display area to fit a tablet
in their pockets is clearly the wrong trade-off.</p>

<p>The seven-inch tablets are tweeners: too big to compete with a
smartphone, and too small to compete with an iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how can we square the idea of Apple making an iPad Mini with Jobs&#8217;s remarks from just a year and a half ago? We could point out (again) that 7.85 inches is closer to 8 inches than 7, and that the exact size of the purported iPad Mini display offers 66 percent of the surface area of a 9.7-inch iPad, not 45 percent. We could point out (again) that, assuming Apple-recommended 44-point user interface tap targets on a display with 163 points per inch, it should offer tap targets of the <em>exact</em> same physical size as every iPhone made to date, thus avoiding the need for Apple to include sandpaper with the device.<sup id="fnr2-2012-07-09"><a href="#fn2-2012-07-09">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We could point out that what Jobs was trashing on that call wasn&#8217;t so much smaller tablets in general as the specific actual smaller tablets then entering the market &#8212; led by <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/01/samsung-galaxy-tab-review/">the Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>. The remainder of his screed after the portion quoted above was quite specific: those tablets (circa October 2010) were running versions of Android that were never meant for larger-than-phone-sized displays, the Android app landscape was anemic at the time, and, perhaps most devastating, those devices were priced as high as or higher than the iPad. The contract-free Galaxy Tab cost $600, and it cost $400 with a monthly contract &#8212; which contract cost $30 a month to start. In short, a $600 Galaxy Tab running Android 2.2 is a far cry from a $200 Nexus 7 running Android 4.1. And we know that Jobs was proven exactly right: those tablets were dead on arrival.</p>

<p>We could point out a pattern that <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/02/steve-jobs/">repeated throughout Jobs&#8217;s career</a>: Jobs saying Apple wouldn&#8217;t do <em>X</em> or that <em>X</em> was a bad idea; then, a year or two later, Jobs would unveil Apple&#8217;s take on <em>X</em> and herald it as a wholly original Apple innovation. In 2003, <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Steve_Jobs_No_Tablet_No_PDA_No_Cell_Phone_Lots_Of_iPods/">he told Walt Mossberg</a> no one would want to watch video on a tiny iPod display, that Apple had no interest in the cell phone business, and no interest in the tablet market, either, saying, &#8220;It turns out people want keyboards. [&#8230;] We look at the tablet, and we think it is going to fail.&#8221; Jobs, of course, went on to introduce the first video-playing iPod in 2005, the iPhone in 2007, and a keyboard-less tablet called the iPad in 2010. <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/the-passion-of-steve-jobs/">He told John Markoff</a> in 2008 that e-books were doomed: &#8220;It doesn’t matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is that people don’t read anymore.&#8221; Two years later he unveiled the iBookstore.</p>

<p>We could point out that Tim Cook, just over a month ago at this year&#8217;s All Things D conference, declared that the ability to change his mind was <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120529/steve-jobs-was-an-awesome-flip-flopper-says-tim-cook/">among the most important things Cook learned from Jobs</a>: &#8220;He would flip on something so fast that you would forget that he was the one taking the 180 degree polar [opposite] position the day before. I saw it daily. This is a gift, because things do change, and it takes courage to change. It takes courage to say, ‘I was wrong.’ I think he had that.”</p>

<p>We could point out all of those things, but in the end none of them matter. All that matters is whether a smaller iPad would actually be good. If Apple ships it, it will be judged on its own merits, regardless of what Steve Jobs said 18 months ago. That&#8217;s it.</p>

<h2>That the Purported Device&#8217;s Display Is, Purportedly, Not Retina</h2>

<p>Another strain of skepticism I&#8217;ve seen goes along the following lines:</p>

<p><em>It&#8217;s one thing for Apple to continue selling the iPhone 3GS and iPad 2, but I can&#8217;t see Apple introducing a new device with a non-retina display.</em></p>

<p>It does seem curious. But it <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/01/agitators">also seemed curious back</a> in January 2004 when Apple unveiled the 4 GB iPod Mini for $249, given that for just $50 more you could buy the regular iPod, which had 15 GB of storage. Trade-offs have to be made. When Apple designed the iPod Mini, they optimized for one factor: a reduction in physical size and weight. The consequences of that trade-off were that the iPod Mini wasn&#8217;t much cheaper than the regular iPod, and it had far less storage capacity.</p>

<p>If Apple were to ship a 7.85-inch iPad with a non-retina 163-ppi display, it would signify that one of the key factors they&#8217;re optimizing for is cost. Unlike that iPod Mini, which was smaller but cost almost as much as its bigger sibling, perhaps this iPad Mini is smaller and costs much less &#8212; at the expense, for one thing, of display quality. This, of course, would pave the way for a retina update a year or two down the line.</p>

<p>Which in turn suggests a way to turn this strain of skepticism on its head. Apple, to date, has never introduced a new iOS form factor with a retina display &#8212; they add retina displays as upgrades two or three years after devices hit the market.</p>

<p>And, by introducing the iPad Mini with a non-retina display but a lower price, it would instantly establish which product is the &#8220;best&#8221; (iPad (3)) and which is the low-cost model (iPad Mini). In this way, I envision the iPad/iPad Mini relationship being very different from the iPod/iPod Mini one, where the two products were nearly evenly priced and you chose between storage capacity (iPod) and device size/weight (iPod Mini).</p>

<h2>Price</h2>

<p>Speaking of price, <a href="http://tracks.ranea.org/post/26571046083/7-inch-ipad-maybe-but-199">Watts Martin doesn&#8217;t think Apple could hit the $199 mark</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple makes as much money as they do &#8212; a whole lot of money
indeed &#8212; by being strategic about what money they go after.
They’re fine with being a “premium” brand. And even as good as
their supply chain management is, I don’t think Apple can produce
a 7-inch iPad for $140.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s why I think Apple could sell it for $199. If Google can sell the 1280&#8201;&#215;&#8201;800 pixel Nexus 7 for $199 and break even on it, I think Apple could produce a 1024&#8201;&#215;&#8201;768 7.85-inch iPad for a break-even price of, say, $150. Charge $199 and that&#8217;s a decent (but, admittedly, low by Apple&#8217;s astounding standards) 25 percent margin.</p>

<p>Why do I think Apple could produce it for less than Google/Asus? Because Apple has such tremendous economy-of-scale advantages. But maybe Martin is right, and iPad Mini prices will &#8212; <em>if</em> the thing is real &#8212; start at $249. It certainly wouldn&#8217;t be outlandish for Apple to charge some sort of premium over the base price of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire (although who knows what this year&#8217;s Kindle Fire will cost &#8212; Amazon has been relentless about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/amazons_new_kindles">reducing the price of Kindle hardware year-over-year</a>).</p>

<p>But as important as profit margins are to Apple, sometimes opportunities arise that are exceptions to the rule. iPhones and iPads are not just devices. They are the foundation for what is turning into the biggest software platform since DOS/Windows, and what is already the most profitable one.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s again return to one Mr. Steven Paul Jobs, this time from his (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/25/critical-juncture.php">oft-cited</a> by yours truly) <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/03/ipod_juggernaut">2004 interview with Steven Levy</a> for Newsweek, regarding how the Mac got stuck with so little market share:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If that’s so, then why is the Mac market share, even after Apple’s
recent revival, sputtering at a measly 5 percent? Jobs has a
theory about that, too. Once a company devises a great product, he
says, it has a monopoly in that realm, and concentrates less on
innovation than protecting its turf. “The Mac user interface was a
10-year monopoly,” says Jobs. “Who ended up running the company?
<em>Sales guys.</em> At the critical juncture in the late ’80s, when they
should have gone for market share, they went for profits. They
made obscene profits for several years. And their products became
mediocre. And then their monopoly ended with Windows 95. They
behaved like a monopoly, and it came back to bite them, which
always happens.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s still all about profit. The tension is between short-term profit margins (focusing on average selling price and profit per iPad sold by ceding the market for smaller cheaper tablets to Google and Amazon) and long-term profit (from maximizing market share as soon as possible, while the post-PC market landscape remains nascent and fluid).</p>

<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10225484-37.html">Here&#8217;s Tom Krazit quoting Tim Cook back in 2009</a> (regarding the iPhone, but I think even more applicable in the tablet market):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Wednesday, Cook echoed Jobs&#8217; comments about iPhone pricing by
saying &#8220;one thing we&#8217;ll make sure is that we don&#8217;t leave a price
umbrella for people.&#8221; A price umbrella is a term used to describe
the effect a dominant company can have on a particular market with
a popular-yet-expensive product: competitors can enter the market
with other products at lower prices and gain customers just based
on affordability, buying those companies time and profits to use
in order to make their product better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple followed that strategy a decade ago with the iPod. Though the stakes are now far higher, I see no reason they wouldn&#8217;t do the same this decade with the iPad.</p>

]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Clayton Christensen, author of the deservedly much-praised <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0060521996/ref=nosim/daringfirebal-20">The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</a></em>, was <a href="http://jeremy.linuxquestions.org/2007/06/28/clayton-christensens-innovators-dilemma-says-iphone-will-fail/">wrong about the iPhone five years ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So music on the mobile phone is going to disrupt the iPod? But
Apple’s just about to launch the iPhone. The iPhone is a
sustaining technology relative to Nokia. In other words, Apple is
leaping ahead on the sustaining curve [by building a better
phone]. But the prediction of the theory would be that Apple won’t
succeed with the iPhone. They’ve launched an innovation that the
existing players in the industry are heavily motivated to beat:
It’s not [truly] disruptive. History speaks pretty loudly on that,
that the probability of success is going to be limited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last month <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/14/120514fa_fact_macfarquhar">Larissa MacFarquhar profiled Christensen</a> in The New Yorker (subscribers-only, alas), and in a parenthetical, succinctly explained why he got the iPhone wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One CEO who never asked for his help, despite his admiration for
<em>The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</em>, was Steve Jobs, which was fortunate,
because Christiansen&#8217;s most embarrassing prediction was that the
iPhone would not succeed. Being a low-end guy, Christiansen saw it
as a fancy cell phone; it was only later that he realized that it
was also disruptive to laptops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This explains everything that has happened to both the computer and phone industries over the past five years. The iPhone is not and never was a phone.<sup id="fnr1-2012-07-02"><a href="#fn1-2012-07-02">1</a></sup> It is a pocket-sized computer that <em>obviates</em> the phone. The iPhone is to cell phones what the Mac was to typewriters.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/blackberry_vs_iphone">I wrote about this back in May 2008</a>, positing that RIM was then already likely screwed because the future of the industry was about making computers, not phones or messaging devices, and RIM had no institutional experience as a computer maker, on either the hardware or software sides of the fence. With Apple, on the other hand, you can more or less look back at the decade preceding the original iPhone as a series of training exercises for what was to come: building portable computers (PowerBooks, iBooks, MacBooks) and pocketable devices (iPods).</p>

<p>The iPod&#8217;s success fooled almost everyone (including me) into thinking that Apple&#8217;s entry into the phone market would be similar. The iPod was the world&#8217;s best portable media player; the &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, thus, would likely be the world&#8217;s best cell phone.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not what it was. It was the world&#8217;s best portable computer. Best not in the sense of being the most powerful, or the fastest, or the most-efficient to use. The thing couldn&#8217;t even do copy-and-paste. It was the best because it was always there, always on, always just a button-push away. The disruption was not that we now finally had a nice phone; it was that, for better or for worse, we would now never again be without a computer or the Internet. It was the Mac side of Apple, not the iPod side, that set the engineering foundation for the iPhone.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s happened over the last five years shows not that Apple disrupted the phone handset industry, but rather that Apple <em>destroyed</em> the handset industry &#8212; by disrupting the computer industry. Today, cell phones are apps, not devices. The companies that were the most successful at selling cell phones pre-iPhone are now <a href="http://www.palm.com/">dead</a> or <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/07/02/rims-tailspin/">dying</a>. Amazon, Google, and now even Microsoft are designing and selling their own integrated touchscreen portable tablets. &#8220;App&#8221; is now a household word.</p>

<p>All of this, because of the iPhone.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn1-2012-07-02">
<p>I wonder how many people would have formed a different, more accurate, perception of the iPhone and its implications for the future if Apple hadn&#8217;t put &#8220;phone&#8221; in the name. Ken Segall recently revealed that <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/apple/3361300/steve-jobs-silly-apple-names-enemies-rows-with-jony-ive/">one of the first names Apple considered for the iPhone was &#8220;iPad&#8221;</a>, which, if you think about it, is actually a more apt name for the thing. The iPhone is not a phone with other secondary features. It&#8217;s a general purpose pocket-sized touchscreen computer, that happens to include cellular phone networking as a feature.</p>

<p>Marketing-wise, it&#8217;s hard to argue with the iPhone&#8217;s success. And I suspect the misdirection of the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221; helped Apple in this regard. By framing it merely as a cool new phone rather than a revolutionary new computing platform, Apple positioned the iPhone as something people in the mass market already thought they wanted. But I think the &#8220;iPhone&#8221; name also misdirected pundits, analysts, and <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/17002229521/lets-see-how-the-competition-goes-just-to">competing executives</a> who should have known better.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2012-07-02"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Surface is fundamentally <em>not</em> about Microsoft needing to control the entire integrated product in order to compete with the iPad on design. It&#8217;s about Microsoft needing to sell the whole thing to sustain its current profitability.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Watching <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3096420/microsoft-surface-event-video-live/in/2859835">the Microsoft Surface event video</a>, I sensed uneasiness. Not panic, but discomfort. Some will argue that I&#8217;m simply spoiled by Apple&#8217;s on-stage polish, but Monday&#8217;s Microsoft event struck me as rushed and severely under-rehearsed. Ballmer offered nothing but blustering bromides, and nothing even vaguely resembling a coherent answer to the big question: Why? Steven Sinofsky was nervous and hurried. It didn&#8217;t help that his first Surface RT unit <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/video-surface-vs-ipad-microsofts-getting-rusty-at-stealing-from-apple.php">crashed before he&#8217;d done anything other than wake it up</a>. There was a moment where he said Surface was perfect for sitting down, relaxing in a chair, and watching a movie. He sat in that chair for about three seconds before rushing into the next segment.</p>

<p>I found the presenters far less rehearsed and the presentation far less cohesive than an Apple event. (With the notable exception of designer Panos Panay, who was very solid on stage.) There was no story. It was all over the place: <em>Here&#8217;s an ARM tablet. Here&#8217;s the clever keyboard cover that goes with it. Now here&#8217;s another tablet that looks much the same but a little thicker but in fact is running a different and incompatible OS. Oh and here&#8217;s another keyboard cover, this one with moving keys.</em> Design is about making decisions, and Microsoft could not decide. ARM or Intel? Who should be on stage? Soft or hard keys on the keyboard cover? They went with &#8220;all of the above&#8221;.</p>

<p>The only hard decision they made was the big one: to turn against their OEM hardware partners.</p>

<p>I presume Microsoft timed this event to jump ahead of anything Google might be announcing at their I/O conference next week &#8212; and the consensus seems to be that Google is going to announce much the same idea: their own Google-branded, Google-designed tablet that will put them in direct competition not just with Apple but with their own OS licensees.</p>

<p>But no pricing, no battery life specs, no demonstrations of the seemingly extraordinarily clever cover-keyboards in action, or really much in the way of software demonstrations, period? That&#8217;s rough, even by the standards of pre-announcements. Skepticism about these things doesn&#8217;t require knee-jerk Apple fandom. It simply requires an open set of eyeballs. The message I took away is that Microsoft has concluded that, ready or not, it needed to move now. There is no longer enough profit to be had selling software alone.</p>

<hr />

<p>Remember <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-announces-ipad/id275834665?i=80469507">the introduction of the original iPad</a> at the end of January 2010? The only product Steve Jobs talked about on stage was the iPad, but the presentation was about much more. Jobs opened by talking about Apple having crossed the $50 billion annual revenue threshold. (They&#8217;ve since gone on to cross the $100 billion threshold.) And they spent a large part of the event talking about the iPad&#8217;s integrated system-on-a-chip, the A4. I concluded <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/ipad_big_picture">my take on the event</a> thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They’re Microsoft and Intel rolled into one when it comes to
mobile computing. In the pre-taped video Apple showed, Bob
Mansfield said of the iPad, “No one else could do it.” Only Apple.</p>

<p>And so my takeaway from this &#8212; with the bragging about making
their own CPUs and their annual revenue and their size compared
to companies like Sony, Samsung, and Nokia &#8212; is that this is
Apple’s way of asserting that they’re taking over the penthouse
suite as the strongest and best company in the whole
ones-and-zeroes racket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, it&#8217;s now clear, was correct. If anything, it was understated &#8212; Apple is now the strongest and most successful company in the world, across any and all industries.</p>

<p>If not for the iPad &#8212; imagine, for a moment, that the company still to this day had not shipped a tablet &#8212; Apple would still be thriving, based on huge (and hugely profitable) iPhone sales and the Mac&#8217;s steady continuing growth (six years of consecutive quarterly growth ahead of the overall PC industry). But it was the iPad that pushed Apple over the top. The iPhone suggested Apple would dominate pocket computing. The iPad suggests Apple will dominate computing, period.</p>

<p>Microsoft this week showed itself willing to do what was once unthinkable: design and sell its own PC hardware. This is a profound change of direction for Microsoft and the entire PC industry. The iPad, however, has been out for so long and has been so successful that no one seemed shocked by Microsoft&#8217;s announcement. But make no mistake: for better or for worse, Surface marks a watershed moment in PC industry history.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/214917669491720192">Harry McCracken</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After 37 years, Microsoft agrees with Alan Kay: &#8220;People who are
really serious about software should make their own hardware.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ever-astute Lessien, tweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/Lessien/status/214893940854374403">shortly after Microsoft&#8217;s event</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft&#8217;s move today suggests it feared the irretrievable loss
of the tablet market to iPad, if it continued to rely on
third-party OEMs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d go further, and argue they fear losing not just the tablet market, but the PC market as a whole. Not in sheer numbers, but in sheer <em>profit</em>. Apple doesn&#8217;t want to sell all of the world&#8217;s computers and phones; rather, Apple wants to reap all the profits in the computer and phone industries. There is no threat that Windows goes away, but there is a serious threat that Microsoft&#8217;s profit from Windows greatly diminishes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/06/20/who-will-be-microsofts-tim-cook/">Horace Dediu, today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we simply divide revenues by PCs sold we get about $55 Windows
revenues per PC and $68 of Office revenues per PC sold. The
total income for Microsoft per PC sold is therefore about $123. If
we divide operating income by PCs as well we get $35 per Windows
license and $43 per Office license. That’s a total of $78 of
operating profit per PC.</p>

<p>Now let’s think about a post-PC future exemplified by the iPad.
Apple sells the iPad with a nearly 33% margin but at a higher
average price than Microsoft’s software bundle. Apple gives away
the software (and apps are very cheap) but it still gains $195 in
operating profit per iPad sold.</p>

<p>Fine, you say, but Microsoft make up for it in volume. Well,
that’s a problem. The tablet volumes are expanding very quickly
and are on track to overtake traditional PCs while traditional PCs
are likely to be disrupted and decline.</p>

<p>So Microsoft faces a dilemma. Their business model of expensive
software on cheap hardware is not sustainable. The future is
nearly free software integrated into moderately priced hardware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There we have it: four short paragraphs that explain why Microsoft has turned its guns against PC-making OEMs. This move was driven by the iPad, but competitively it directly pits Microsoft not against Apple but against Dell, HP, Toshiba, et al. The intention is obviously to slow the iPad down, but the radical shift in Microsoft&#8217;s strategy is about the fight over the profits that remain after Apple&#8217;s. The math no longer works out for the Windows <em>you-sell-the-hardware-we-sell-the-software</em> model. It works for unit share (cf. Android), but it doesn&#8217;t for profit share. Nothing works sustainably in business without profit &#8212; profit is the oxygen companies breathe.</p>

<p>Even if Apple&#8217;s growth soon slows, Apple already reaps a massive share of the industry&#8217;s profits. And if Apple&#8217;s growth <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> slow in the next year or two, look out. All of Apple&#8217;s competitors in the phone industry, save Samsung, are now starving for profit. They&#8217;re dying, all of them &#8212; HTC is breaking even and the rest are deep in the red.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/04/ipad_sales_context">The iPad is growing faster than the iPhone</a>. The Mac already owns the $999-and-over market (where the margins are), and the iPad owns the tablet market (where the growth is). The PC market is quickly heading to where the phone market already is.</p>

<p>Microsoft Surface is <em>not</em> fundamentally about Microsoft needing to control the entire integrated product in order to compete with the iPad on design. It&#8217;s about Microsoft needing to sell the whole thing to sustain its current profitability.</p>

<p>Surface is a bold move, and classic Microsoft. If the OEMs don&#8217;t like it &#8212; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/19/us-microsoft-windows-tablets-asia-idUSBRE85I1NL20120619">and they do not</a> &#8212; what are they going to do? Turn to Linux (which no one wants) or Android (which no one wants on anything other than phones)? It&#8217;s the OEMs whom Microsoft thinks Surface can put into checkmate, not Apple.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;m right, it&#8217;s inevitable now that Microsoft will acquire Nokia.</p>

]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<h2>1.</h2>

<p>On the software side, Apple has &#8212; dare I say <em>finally</em> &#8212; become a company that can walk and chew gum at the same time. Remember back in 2007 when Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) was delayed six months because, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/12/apple-announces-leopard-delays-due-to-the-iphone/">Apple flat-out admitted</a>, they had to pull engineering talent from Mac OS X to work on iOS 1 for the original iPhone? They don&#8217;t seem to have that problem any more.</p>

<p>Today, Apple has two OSes that are both in active concurrent development. Year-over-year, it&#8217;s hard to say which OS has seen the most improvement.</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>The new &#8220;next-generation&#8221; MacBook Pro with Retina Display is, in short, &#8220;Back to the Mac&#8221; for hardware. This is an iOS-inspired appliance &#8212; battery, RAM, solid state storage &#8212; all of it is sealed in a magnificent enclosure. Consider too that it no longer even says &#8220;MacBook Pro&#8221; on the front of the display. It&#8217;s just like an iOS device &#8212; a brilliant display surrounded by black glass.</p>

<p>I have a review unit from Apple, and after just 15 minutes or so trying it out, it&#8217;s damn impressive. Much like with the iPhone and iPad, it&#8217;s not so much that the retina display looks good as that, after you&#8217;ve used it for even just a few minutes, non-retina display MacBooks look bad. It&#8217;s not just pixel size, either &#8212; color, brightness, viewing angles &#8212; everything about it is amazing. Best display I&#8217;ve ever seen, period.</p>

<p>The catch is that it&#8217;s expensive. That&#8217;s why it debuted alongside a brand-new update to the 15-inch non-retina MacBook Pro, rather than replacing it. If you can afford it (and don&#8217;t need the optical drive or spinning hard disk), you want the new one. And surely we&#8217;re going to see displays of this caliber roll out across the MacBook line, one by one, as soon as it becomes economically feasible. (And, I presume, the iMac and Cinema Displays, too. It&#8217;s just a matter of time.)</p>

<p>Best to compare it to the original MacBook Air from 2008. The first Air was expensive and not for everyone, but it showed the future of Apple&#8217;s (and, really, the industry&#8217;s) portables. That&#8217;s what the new 15-inch MacBook Pro is: the future of portable Macs.</p>

<h2>3.</h2>

<p>Starting with the opening gag with Siri doing stand-up comedy and continuing through to Apple&#8217;s new maps and Siri&#8217;s new features, there was an unmistakeable &#8220;Fuck you, Google&#8221; undertone to the whole keynote. Apple is forcing Google out of iOS. Even the Facebook integration feels like a &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221; alliance.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/29/google-android-profits">said it before</a> and will say it again: Google made a mistake by deciding to oppose rather than ally with Apple on mobile.</p>
