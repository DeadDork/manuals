<H3>Blank Spaces and Carriage Returns in the Input File</H3>

<P>
LaTeX treats the carriage return at the end of a line
as though it were a blank space.  Similarly LaTeX treats
tab characters as blank spaces.  Moreover, LaTeX regards
a sequence of blank spaces as though it were a single
space, and similarly it will ignore blank spaces at the
beginning or end of a line in the input file.  Thus, for
example, if we type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
This is
    a
        silly
  example   of   LaTeX input
with many spaces.


                   This is the beginning
of a new paragraph.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
then we obtain
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="EX_silly.gif" ALT="[GIF Image]" ><!-- BeginTeX GIF="EX_silly.gif"
This is
    a
        silly
  example   of   LaTeX input
with many spaces.


                   This is the beginning
of a new paragraph.
EndTeX -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It follows immediately from this that one will obtain
the same results whether one types one space or two spaces
after a full stop: LaTeX does not distinguish between the
two cases.
</P>

<P>
Any spaces which follow a control sequence will be ignored
by LaTeX.
</P>

<P>
A space following a control sequence may be obtained by preceding
the space with a <EM>backslash</EM> <CODE>\</CODE>.  For example,
the sentence
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="EX_power.gif" ALT="[GIF Image]" ><!-- BeginTeX GIF="EX_power.gif"
\LaTeX\ is a very powerful computer typesetting program.
EndTeX -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
is obtained by typing
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
\LaTeX\ is a very powerful computer typesetting program.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(Here the control sequence <CODE>\LaTeX</CODE> is used to produce
the LaTeX logo.)
</P>

<P>
A blank space should not occur in the input file after a left
parenthesis or before a right parenthesis.
