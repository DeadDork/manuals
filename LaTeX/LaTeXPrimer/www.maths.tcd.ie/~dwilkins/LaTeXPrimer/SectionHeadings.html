<H3>Section Headings in LaTeX</H3>

<P>
Section headings of various sizes are produced (in the
<STRONG>article</STRONG> document style) using the commands
<CODE>\section</CODE>,<CODE>\subsection</CODE> and
<CODE>\subsubsection</CODE>
commands. LaTeX will number the sections and subsections
automatically.  The title of the section should be surrounded
by braces and placed immediately after the relevant
command.  Thus if we type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
\section{Section Headings}

We explain in this section how to obtain headings
for the various sections and subsections of our
document.

\subsection{Headings in the `article' Document Style}

In the `article' style, the document may be divided up
into sections, subsections and subsubsections, and each
can be given a title, printed in a boldface font,
simply by issuing the appropriate command.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
then the title of the section and that of the subsection
will be printed in a large boldface font, and will be
numbered accordingly.
</P>

<P>
Other document styles (such as the <STRONG>book</STRONG> and
<STRONG>letter</STRONG> styles) have other `sectioning'
commands available (for example, the <STRONG>book</STRONG>
style has a <CODE>\chapter</CODE> command for beginning
a new chapter).
</P>

<P>
Sometimes one wishes to suppress the automatic numbering
provided by LaTeX.  This can be done by placing an
asterisk before the title of the section or subsection.
Thus, for example, the section numbers in the above example
could be suppressed by typing
<BLOCKQUOTE>
