<P>
There are various control sequences for producing underlining,
overlining and various accents in mathematics mode.  The
following table lists these control sequences, applying them
to the letter <I>a</I>:

It should be borne in mind that when a character is underlined in
a mathematical manuscript then it is normally typeset in
bold face without any underlining. Underlining is used very
rarely in print.

<P>
The control sequences such as <CODE>\'</CODE> and <CODE>\"</CODE>, used
to produce accents in ordinary text, may not be used in
mathematics mode.
