<P>
TeX is a computer program for typesetting documents, created
by D. E. Knuth.  It takes a suitably prepared computer file and
converts it to a form that may be printed on many kinds of printers,
including dot-matrix printers, laser printers and
high-resolution typesetting machines.  A number of
well-established publishers now use TeX in order to typeset
books and mathematical journals.

<P>
Simple documents that do not contain mathematical formulae
or tables may be produced very easily: the body of the
text is typed in essentially unaltered (though observing
certain rules regarding quotation marks and punctuation dashes).
Typesetting mathematics is somewhat more involved, but even here
TeX is comparatively straightforward to use when one
considers the complexity of some of the formulae that it
is required to typeset.

LaTeX, written by L. B. Lamport, is one of a number of
`dialects' of TeX.  It is particularly suited to the production
of long articles and books, since it has facilities for the
automatic numbering of chapters, sections, theorems, equations etc.,
and also has facilities for cross-referencing.  It is probably one
of the most suitable version of LaTeX for beginners to use.

This introduction describes basic features of
LaTeX2e, released in 1994.  Further
information on LaTeX is to be found in the 2nd edition of
<CITE>LaTeX User's Guide and Reference Manual</CITE>
by Leslie Lamport, and in <CITE>The LaTeX Companion</CITE> by
Michel Goossens, Frank Mittelbach and Alexander Samarin.
