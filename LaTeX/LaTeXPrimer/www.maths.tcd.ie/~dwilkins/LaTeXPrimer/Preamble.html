<H3>The Preamble of the LaTeX Input file</H3>

<P>
We describe the options available in LaTeX for specifying
the overall style of a document.
</P>

<P>
A LaTeX document should begin with a <CODE>\documentclass</CODE>
command and any text to be printed must be included between
<CODE>\begin{document}</CODE> and <CODE>\end{document}</CODE>
commands.  The <CODE>\begin{document}</CODE> command is often
preceded by commands that set the page-style and set up
user-defined control sequences.
</P>

<P>
Here is a typical LaTeX input file:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\begin{document}

This is the first paragraph of a typical document. It is
produced in a `12~point' size. A \emph{point} is a unit
of length used by printers. One point is approximately
$1/72$~inch. In a `12~point' font the height of the
parentheses is 12~points (i.e. about $1/6$~inch) and the
letter~`m' is about 12 points long. 

This is the second paragraph of the document. There are
also `10 point' and `11 point' styles available in LaTeX.
The required size is specified in the `documentstyle'
command. If no such size is specified then the 10~point
size is assumed.

\end{document}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>
The syntax of the <CODE>\documentclass</CODE> command is as
follows. The command begins with <CODE>\documentclass</CODE>
and ends with the names of one of the available styles,
enclosed in braces. The available styles are
<CODE>article</CODE>, <CODE>report</CODE>, <CODE>book</CODE>
and <CODE>letter</CODE>. Between the ``<CODE>\documentclass</CODE>''
and the name of the document style, one may place a
list of <EM>options</EM>. These options are separated by
commas and the list of options is enclosed in square
brackets (as in the above example). The options
available include the following:
<DL>
<DT><CODE>11pt</CODE>
<DD>Specifies a size of type known as
   <EM>eleven-point</EM>, which is ten percent larger than
   the ten-point type normally used.
<DT><CODE>12pt</CODE>
<DD>Specifies a twelve-point type size, which is
   twenty percent larger than ten-point.
<DT><CODE>twocolumn</CODE>
<DD>Produces two-column output.
<DT><CODE>a4paper</CODE>
<DD>This ensures that the page is appropriately positioned
   on A4 size paper.
</DL>
</P>

<P>
Typing simply <CODE>\documentclass{article}</CODE> will produce a
document in ten-point type size. However the printed output
will not be nicely positioned on A4 paper, since the default
size is intended for a different (American) paper size.
</P>

<P>
Pages will be automatically numbered at the bottom of the
page, unless you specify otherwise. This can be done using the
<CODE>\pagestyle</CODE> command. This command should come after the
<CODE>\documentclass</CODE> command and before the
<CODE>\begin{document}</CODE> command. This command has the
syntax <CODE>\pagestyle{</CODE><EM>option</EM><CODE>}</CODE>, where
the <EM>option</EM> is one of the following:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>plain</STRONG>
<DD>The page number is at the foot of the page.
   This is the default page style for the <CODE>article</CODE>
   and <CODE>report</CODE> document styles.
<DT><STRONG>empty</STRONG>
<DD>No page number is printed.
<DT><STRONG>headings</STRONG>
<DD>The page number (and any other information
   determined by the document style) is put at the top of
   the page.
<DT><STRONG>myheadings</STRONG>
<DD>Similar to the <STRONG>headings</STRONG> pagestyle,
   except that the material to go at the top of the
   page is determined by <CODE>\markboth</CODE> and
   <CODE>\markright</CODE> commands (see the LaTeX manual).
</DL>
For example, the input file
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
The main body of the document is placed here.
\end{document}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
produces a document without page numbers, using the
standard ten-point type size.
