<H3>Quotation Marks and Dashes</H3>

<P>
Single quotation marks are produced in LaTeX using
<CODE>`</CODE> and <CODE>'</CODE>.  Double quotation marks are
produced by typing <CODE>``</CODE> and <CODE>''</CODE>.  (The
`undirected double quote character <CODE>"</CODE> produces
double right quotation marks: it should <EM>never</EM> be
used where left quotation marks are required.)
</P>

<P>
LaTeX allows you to produce dashes of various length, known as
`hyphens', `en-dashes' and `em-dashes'.  Hyphens are obtained
in LaTeX by typing <CODE>-</CODE>, en-dashes by typing <CODE>--</CODE> and
em-dashes by typing <CODE>---</CODE>.
</P>

<P>
One normally uses en-dashes when specifying a range of numbers.
Thus for example, to specify a range of page numbers, one would type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
on pages 155--219.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Dashes used for punctuating are often typeset as em-dashes,
especially in older books.  These are obtained by typing
<CODE>---</CODE>.

``You \emph{were} a little grave,'' said Alice.

``Well just then I was inventing a new way of
getting over a gate---would you like to hear it?''

``Very much indeed,'' Alice said politely.

``I'll tell you how I came to think of it,'' said
the Knight.  ``You see, I said to myself `The only
difficulty is with the feet: the \emph{head} is
high enough already.'  Now, first I put my head on
the top of the gate---then the head's high
enough---then I stand on my head---then the feet
are high enough, you see---then I'm over, you see.''

(taken from <EM>Alice through the Looking Glass</EM>, by Lewis Carroll)
illustrates the use of quotation marks and dashes.  It is obtained in
LaTeX from the following input:

Sometimes you need single quotes immediately following double quotes,
or vica versa, as in

``I regard computer typesetting as being reasonably
`straightforward'\,'' he said.
EndTeX -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The way to typeset this correctly in LaTeX is to use the
control sequence <CODE>\,</CODE> between the quotation marks,
so as to obtain the necessary amount of separation.  The above
example is thus produced with the input
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
``I regard computer typesetting as being reasonably
`straightforward'\,'' he said.
