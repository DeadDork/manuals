Of course, there is a way to let Steve give Michele the same permissions that
he has when she&#8217;s running the summarize program.  Steve types this:
</p>
<pre>
   chmod u+s summarize
</pre>
<p>
This means &#8220;Add the <b>Set User ID</b> capability for the <b>u</b>ser
who owns the file to <code>summarize</code>.&#8221;  Now his permissions look
like this:
</p>
<pre>
-rw-------  steve  sales  customers.dat
-rw<b>s</b>r-xr-x  steve  sales  summarize
</pre>
<p>
Now let&#8217;s see what happens when Michele runs the program:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th>Event</th><th>Linux says</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Michele types <code>/home/steve/summarize</code>
</td>
<td>
You are user <code>michele</code> of group <code>mktg</code>. <br />
You are &#8220;other&#8221;. <br />
You want to e<b>x</b>ecute file <code>/home/steve/summarize</code>. <br />
Permission granted.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Program begins.
</td>
<td>
<b>Set User ID</b> is in effect.<br />
Alakabaud! &reg; I have changed your user ID. <br />
You are now user <code>steve</code>
for as long as this program runs.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Program asks to read
file <code>/home/steve/customers.dat</code>
</td>
<td>
You are user <code>steve</code>. <br />
You want to <b>r</b>ead file <code>/home/steve/customers.dat</code>.<br />
Permission granted.
</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>
The problem is now solved! Steve can let Michele run his program. His
program temporarily changes Michele&#8217;s user ID to Steve&#8217;s so that the
customer file becomes readable.  If Michele tries to get to the customer file
from any other program, the permissions will keep her out.
</p>

<p>
You may also use a construction like this
to give the group&#8217;s permissions to anyone who runs the program.
</p>
<pre>
   chmod g+s summarize
</pre>
