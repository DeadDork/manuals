<p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    (W) A warning (optional).</li><li>    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).</li><li>    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).</li><li>    (F) A fatal error (trappable).</li><li>    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).</li><li>    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).</li><li>    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</li></ol></pre><p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <b>-w</b>
and <b>-W</b> switches.  Warnings may be captured by setting <code class="inline"><span class="i">$SIG</span>{<span class="w">__WARN__</span>}</code>

to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p>
<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <b>-X</b> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="functions/eval.html">eval</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.
See <a href="warnings.html">warnings</a>.</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="accept()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>accept() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/accept.html">accept</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Allocation-too-large%3a-%25x"></a><b>Allocation too large: %x</b>
<p>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%25c'-allowed-only-after-types-%25s"></a><b>'%c' allowed only after types %s</b>
<p>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in pack() or unpack() only
after certain types.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE%3a%3a%25s()%2c-qualify-as-such-or-use-%26"></a><b>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</b>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">subs</span></code>
 pragma).</p>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::</span></code>
 prefix
on the operator (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::log</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="perlsub.html#Subroutine-Attributes">Subroutine Attributes in perlsub</a> or
<a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator"></a><b>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</b>

immediately followed by "le".  In Perl 5.16 and earlier, this is
resolved as meaning to take the result of the substitution, and see if
it is stringwise less-than-or-equal-to what follows in the expression.
Having the "le" immediately following a pattern is deprecated behavior,
so in Perl 5.18, this expression will be resolved as meaning to do the
pattern match using the rules of the current locale, and evaluate the
rhs as an expression when doing the substitution.  In 5.14, and 5.16 if
you want the latter interpretation, you can simply write "el" instead.
But note that the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/l</span></code>

you should use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code>

<li><a name="Bad-symbol-for-dirhandle"></a><b>Bad symbol for dirhandle</b>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a dirhandle entry to something
that wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>

<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-found-in-conditional"></a><b>Bareword found in conditional</b>
<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FOO</span> || <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">constant</span> <span class="i">TYPO</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="w">TYOP</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;foo&quot;</span> <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">strict</span></code>
 pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-%22%25s%22-not-allowed-while-%22strict-subs%22-in-use"></a><b>Bareword "%s" not allowed while "strict subs" in use</b>
<p>(F) With "strict subs" in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the "=&gt;"
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-%22%25s%22-refers-to-nonexistent-package"></a><b>Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package</b>
<p>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo::</span></code>
, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="BEGIN-failed--compilation-aborted"></a><b>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</b>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="BEGIN-not-safe-after-errors--compilation-aborted"></a><b>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</b>
<p>(F) Perl found a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 subroutine (or a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> directive, which
implies a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%5c1-better-written-as-%241"></a><b>\1 better written as $1</b>
<p>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Binary-number-%3e-0b11111111111111111111111111111111-non-portable"></a><b>Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See

</li>
<li><a name="bind()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>bind() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to

</li>
<li><a name="binmode()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>binmode() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried binmode() on a filehandle that was never opened.
Check your control flow and number of arguments.</p>

<p>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not
copiable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Buffer-overflow-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%25s"></a><b>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to
iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition
which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bizarre-SvTYPE-%5b%25d%5d"></a><b>Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</b>
<p>(P) When starting a new thread or return values from a thread, Perl
encountered an invalid data type.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Callback-called-exit"></a><b>Callback called exit</b>
<p>(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via call_sv()
exited by calling exit.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s()-called-too-early-to-check-prototype"></a><b>%s() called too early to check prototype</b>
<p>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-compress-integer-in-pack"></a><b>Cannot compress integer in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was too large to compress.  The BER
compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you
attempted to compress Infinity or a very large number (&gt; 1e308).
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-compress-negative-numbers-in-pack"></a><b>Cannot compress negative numbers in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was negative.  The BER compressed integer

</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-convert-a-reference-to-%25s-to-typeglob"></a><b>Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</b>
<p>(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference
in it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax.
The access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is
no legal conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-copy-to-%25s"></a><b>Cannot copy to %s</b>
<p>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy a value to an internal type that cannot
be directly assigned to.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-find-encoding-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Cannot find encoding "%s"</b>
<p>(S io) You tried to apply an encoding that did not exist to a filehandle,
either with open() or binmode().</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-set-tied-%40DB%3a%3aargs"></a><b>Cannot set tied @DB::args</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/caller.html">caller</a></code> tried to set <code class="inline"><span class="i">@DB::args</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-tie-unreifiable-array"></a><b>Cannot tie unreifiable array</b>
<p>(P) You somehow managed to call <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tie.html">tie</a></code> on an array that does not
keep a reference count on its arguments and cannot be made to
do so.  Such arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to
Perl code, but are only used internally.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can-only-compress-unsigned-integers-in-pack"></a><b>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was not an integer.  The BER compressed
integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you attempted
to compress something else.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-bless-non-reference-value"></a><b>Can't bless non-reference value</b>
<p>(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl "enforces"
encapsulation of objects.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22break%22-in-a-loop-topicalizer"></a><b>Can't "break" in a loop topicalizer</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code>
, but you're in a <code class="inline">foreach</code>
 block rather than
a <code class="inline">given</code>
 block.  You probably meant to use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last.html">last</a></code>.</p>
</li>

<li><a name="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-on-an-undefined-value"></a><b>Can't call method "%s" on an undefined value</b>
<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the

<li><a name="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-on-unblessed-reference"></a><b>Can't call method "%s" on unblessed reference</b>
<p>(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't an
object reference until it has been blessed.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-without-a-package-or-object-reference"></a><b>Can't call method "%s" without a package or object reference</b>
<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the

<p>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't
say things like:</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-declare-%25s-in-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't declare %s in "%s"</b>
<p>(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as "my", "our" or
"state" variables.  They must have ordinary identifiers as names.</p>
</li>

<p>(F) You have used a <code class="inline"><span class="w">default</span></code>
 block that is neither inside a
<code class="inline">foreach</code>
 loop nor a <code class="inline">given</code>
 block.  (Note that this error is
issued on exit from the <code class="inline"><span class="w">default</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-inplace-edit-without-backup"></a><b>Can't do inplace edit without backup</b>
<p>(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try
reading from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say
<code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span>.<span class="w">bak</span></code>
, or some such.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-inplace-edit%3a-%25s-would-not-be-unique"></a><b>Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</b>
<p>(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14

<p>(F) Minima must be less than or equal to maxima.  If you really
want your regexp to match something 0 times, just put {0}.  The
&lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem
was discovered.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-waitpid-with-flags"></a><b>Can't do waitpid with flags</b>
<p>(F) This machine doesn't have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only
waitpid() without flags is emulated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-emulate--%25s-on-%23!-line"></a><b>Can't emulate -%s on #! line</b>
<p>(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%25s-%25s-endian-%25ss-on-this-platform"></a><b>Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform</b>
<p>(F) Your platform's byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian,
or it has a very strange pointer size.  Packing and unpacking big- or

See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-exec-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><b>Can't exec "%s": %s</b>
<p>(W exec) A system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the
permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
, the executable in question was compiled for another
architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an interpreter that
can't be run for similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support
#! at all.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-exec-%25s"></a><b>Can't exec %s</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
that's what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may
need to mention "perl" on the #! line somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-execute-%25s"></a><b>Can't execute %s</b>
<p>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to execute

<li><a name="Can't-find-string-terminator-%25s-anywhere-before-EOF"></a><b>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</b>
<p>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means
that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-get-filespec---stale-stat-buffer%3f"></a><b>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking
routine knows about the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/stat.html">stat</a></code> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>

<li><a name="Can't-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name"></a><b>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-get-SYSGEN-parameter-value-for-MAXBUF"></a><b>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22goto%22-into-the-middle-of-a-foreach-loop"></a><b>Can't "goto" into the middle of a foreach loop</b>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop.  You can't get there from here.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22goto%22-out-of-a-pseudo-block"></a><b>Can't "goto" out of a pseudo block</b>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no.
See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-a-sort-sub-(or-similar-callback)"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</b>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a sort(), or from a similar callback (such
as the reduce() function in List::Util).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-an-eval-%25s"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s</b>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of an eval
"string" or block.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-outside-a-subroutine"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</b>
<p>(F) The deeply magical "goto subroutine" call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD
routine anyway.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-ignore-signal-CHLD%2c-forcing-to-default"></a><b>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</b>
<p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-kill-a-non-numeric-process-ID"></a><b>Can't kill a non-numeric process ID</b>
<p>(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers.  It is a fatal error to
attempt to kill() an undefined, empty-string or otherwise non-numeric
process identifier.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22last%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "last" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "last" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current
block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't count as a "loopish"
block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or grep().  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See
<a href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-linearize-anonymous-symbol-table"></a><b>Can't linearize anonymous symbol table</b>
<p>(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
package, but failed because the package stash has no name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-load-'%25s'-for-module-%25s"></a><b>Can't load '%s' for module %s</b>
<p>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension.
This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one
that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known
to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your
dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library
that is installed on your system.  You may need to rebuild your old
dynamic extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-localize-lexical-variable-%25s"></a><b>Can't localize lexical variable %s</b>
<p>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using "my" or "state".  This is not allowed.  If you
want to localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with
the package name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-localize-through-a-reference"></a><b>Can't localize through a reference</b>
<p>(F) You said something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">$$ref</span></code>
, which Perl can't currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can't be sure
that $ref will still be a reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-%25s"></a><b>Can't locate %s</b>
<p>(F) You said to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code> (or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code>) a file that couldn't be found.
Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless
the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you need
to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the
extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See
<a href="functions/require.html">require</a> and <a href="lib.html">lib</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-auto%2f%25s.al-in-%40INC"></a><b>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</b>
<p>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows
autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes
are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to <code class="inline"><span class="w">AutoSplit</span></code>

the file, say, by doing <code class="inline"><span class="w">make</span> <span class="w">install</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-loadable-object-for-module-%25s-in-%40INC"></a><b>Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</b>
<p>(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like
for example, <i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a> module was
unable to locate this library.  See <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-object-method-%22%25s%22-via-package-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-package-%25s-for-%40%25s%3a%3aISA"></a><b>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</b>
<p>(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that
doesn't seem to exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-PerlIO%25s"></a><b>Can't locate PerlIO%s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use in open() a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
e.g. open(FH, "&gt;:nosuchlayer", "somefile").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-make-list-assignment-to-%25ENV-on-this-system"></a><b>Can't make list assignment to %ENV on this system</b>
<p>(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-%25s-in-%25s"></a><b>Can't modify %s in %s</b>
<p>(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
to change it, such as with an auto-increment.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-nonexistent-substring"></a><b>Can't modify nonexistent substring</b>
<p>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-non-lvalue-subroutine-call"></a><b>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</b>
<p>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such.  See <a href="perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines">Lvalue subroutines in perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-msgrcv-to-read-only-var"></a><b>Can't msgrcv to read-only var</b>
<p>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22next%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "next" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "next" statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or
grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops
once.  See <a href="functions/next.html">next</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-%25s"></a><b>Can't open %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to run a perl built with MAD support with
the PERL_XMLDUMP environment variable set, but the file
named by that variable could not be opened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><b>Can't open %s: %s</b>
<p>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code>

filehandle, either implicitly under the <code class="inline">-<span class="w">n</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">-p</code>
 command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually
this is because you don't have read permission for a file which
you named on the command line.</p>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-e</b> switch, but <i>/dev/null</i> (or
your operating system's equivalent) could not be opened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-a-reference"></a><b>Can't open a reference</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing,
using the 3-arg open() syntax:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FH</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;&gt;&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$ref</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-bidirectional-pipe"></a><b>Can't open bidirectional pipe</b>
<p>(W pipe) You tried to say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">CMD</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;|cmd|&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, which is not supported.
You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such
as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using
"&gt;", and then read it in under a different file handle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-error-file-%25s-as-stderr"></a><b>Can't open error file %s as stderr</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-input-file-%25s-as-stdin"></a><b>Can't open input file %s as stdin</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the
command line for reading.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-output-file-%25s-as-stdout"></a><b>Can't open output file %s as stdout</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-output-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)"></a><b>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined
for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-perl-script-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><b>Can't open perl script "%s": %s</b>
<p>(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.</p>
<p>If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell's $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so
you don't have to type the path or <code class="inline"><span class="q">`which $scriptname`</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-read-CRTL-environ"></a><b>Can't read CRTL environ</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that environ is not
searched.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22redo%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "redo" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "redo" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <a href="functions/redo.html">redo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-remove-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><b>Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</b>
<p>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with
the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-rename-%25s-to-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><b>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</b>
<p>(S inplace) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-reopen-input-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)-in-binary-mode"></a><b>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-reset-%25ENV-on-this-system"></a><b>Can't reset %ENV on this system</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/reset.html">reset('E')</a></code> or similar, which tried to reset
all variables in the current package beginning with "E".  In
the main package, that includes %ENV.  Resetting %ENV is not
supported on some systems, notably VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-resolve-method-%22%25s%22-overloading-%22%25s%22-in-package-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't resolve method "%s" overloading "%s" in package "%s"</b>
<p>(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as
opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the
package.  If the method name is <code class="inline">???</code>, this is an internal error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-%25s-from-lvalue-subroutine"></a><b>Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</b>
<p>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-outside-a-subroutine"></a><b>Can't return outside a subroutine</b>
<p>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-%25s-to-lvalue-scalar-context"></a><b>Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</b>
<p>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue
subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl
think you meant to return only one value.  You probably meant to
write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell
Perl that the call should be in list context.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-stat-script-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't stat script "%s"</b>
<p>(P) For some reason you can't fstat() the script even though you have it
open already.  Bizarre.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-take-log-of-%25g"></a><b>Can't take log of %g</b>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the
negative numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-take-sqrt-of-%25g"></a><b>Can't take sqrt of %g</b>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-undef-active-subroutine"></a><b>Can't undef active subroutine</b>
<p>(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-upgrade-%25s-(%25d)-to-%25d"></a><b>Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d</b>
<p>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds "members" to an SV, making it
into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-'%25c'-after--mname"></a><b>Can't use '%c' after -mname</b>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-m</b> switch, but you put something
other than "=" after the module name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-anonymous-symbol-table-for-method-lookup"></a><b>Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</b>
<p>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol
table that doesn't have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous
for example by undefining stashes: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">%Some::Package::</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-an-undefined-value-as-%25s-reference"></a><b>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</b>
<p>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-bareword-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><b>Can't use bareword ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</b>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%25!-because-Errno.pm-is-not-available"></a><b>Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available</b>
<p>(F) The first time the <code class="inline"><span class="i">%!</span></code>
 hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module.  The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <code class="inline"><span class="i">$!</span></code>
 errno values.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-both-'%3c'-and-'%3e'-after-type-'%25c'-in-%25s"></a><b>Can't use both '&lt;' and '&gt;' after type '%c' in %s</b>
<p>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
allowed.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%25s-for-loop-variable"></a><b>Can't use %s for loop variable</b>
<p>(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a
foreach.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-global-%25s-in-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Can't use global %s in "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-'%25c'-in-a-group-with-different-byte-order-in-%25s"></a><b>Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s</b>
<p>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type
that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier.
For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that
is inside a big-endian group.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%22my-%25s%22-in-sort-comparison"></a><b>Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison</b>
<p>(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%25s-ref-as-%25s-ref"></a><b>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</b>
<p>(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-string-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><b>Can't use string ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</b>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-subscript-on-%25s"></a><b>Can't use subscript on %s</b>
<p>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn't look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-%5c%25c-to-mean-%24%25c-in-expression"></a><b>Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</b>
<p>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-weaken-a-nonreference"></a><b>Can't weaken a nonreference</b>
<p>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-%22when%22-outside-a-topicalizer"></a><b>Can't "when" outside a topicalizer</b>
<p>(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a <code class="inline">foreach</code>

loop nor a <code class="inline">given</code>
 block.  (Note that this error is issued on exit
from the <code class="inline">when</code>
 block, so you won't get the error if the match fails,
or if you use an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue.html">continue</a></code>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-x%3d-to-read-only-value"></a><b>Can't x= to read-only value</b>
<p>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)
with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Character-following-%22%5cc%22-must-be-ASCII"></a><b>Character following "\c" must be ASCII</b>
<p>(F)(W deprecated, syntax) In <code class="inline">\c<i>X</i></code>, <i>X</i> must be an ASCII character.
It is planned to make this fatal in all instances in Perl 5.18.  In the
cases where it isn't fatal, the character this evaluates to is
derived by exclusive or'ing the code point of this character with 0x40.</p>
<p>Note that non-alphabetic ASCII characters are discouraged here as well.</p>
</li>

<p>(W utf8, non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum
of U+10FFFF.</p>
<p>Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, up
to the limit of what is storable in an unsigned integer on your system,
but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.  At one time,
it was legal in some standards to have code points up to 0x7FFF_FFFF,
but not higher.  Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a
32 bit word.</p>
<p>None of the Unicode or Perl-defined properties will match a non-Unicode
code point.  For example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/chr.html">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">0x7FF_FFFF</span><span class="s">)</span> =~ <span class="q">/\p{Any}/</span></li></ol></pre><p>will not match, because the code point is not in Unicode.  But</p>

<li><a name="Complex-regular-subexpression-recursion-limit-(%25d)-exceeded"></a><b>Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded</b>
<p>(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex
situations where back-tracking is required.  Recursion depth is limited
to 32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
arbitrarily.  ("Simple" and "medium" situations are handled without
recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with <code class="inline">while</code>
) rather than
in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so
that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See <a href="perlfaq2.html">perlfaq2</a> for information
on <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>.)</p>

<p>(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to
call cond_broadcast() on a variable which wasn't locked.
The cond_broadcast() function is used to wake up another thread
that is waiting in a cond_wait().  To ensure that the signal isn't
sent before the other thread has a chance to enter the wait, it
is usual for the signaling thread first to wait for a lock on
variable.  This lock attempt will only succeed after the other
thread has entered cond_wait() and thus relinquished the lock.</p>

<p>(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to

<p>(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
100 times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an
infinite recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in
which case it indicates something else.</p>
<p>This threshold can be changed from 100, by recompiling the <i>perl</i> binary,

<li><a name="defined(%40array)-is-deprecated"></a><b>defined(@array) is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it

<p>(D deprecated) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined()</a></code> is not usually right on hashes and has been

weak references, stash names, even remaining true after <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>

These things make <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a> <span class="i">%hash</span></code>

just being DESTROYed.  Perl is confused, and prefers to abort rather
than to create a dangling reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Did-not-produce-a-valid-header"></a><b>Did not produce a valid header</b>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-did-not-return-a-true-value"></a><b>%s did not return a true value</b>
<p>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a "1;", though any true value would
do.  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-%26%25s-instead%3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</b>
<p>(W misc) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or
some such.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-%22local%22-instead-of-%22our%22%3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean "local" instead of "our"?)</b>
<p>(W misc) Remember that "our" does not localize the declared global
variable.  You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which
seems superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-%24-or-%40-instead-of-%25%3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</b>
<p>(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or
@hash{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got
carried away.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Died"></a><b>Died</b>
<p>(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$@</span></code>
 was empty.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Document-contains-no-data"></a><b>Document contains no data</b>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-does-not-define-%25s%3a%3aVERSION--version-check-failed"></a><b>%s does not define %s::VERSION--version check failed</b>
<p>(F) You said something like "use Module 42" but the Module did not
define a <code class="inline"><span class="i">$VERSION</span>.</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%2f'-does-not-take-a-repeat-count"></a><b>'/' does not take a repeat count</b>
<p>(F) You cannot put a repeat count of any kind right after the '/' code.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Don't-know-how-to-handle-magic-of-type-'%25s'"></a><b>Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'</b>
<p>(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="do_study%3a-out-of-memory"></a><b>do_study: out of memory</b>
<p>(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc() instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Do-you-need-to-predeclare-%25s%3f)"></a><b>(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
"sub", "package", "require", or "use" statement.  If you're referencing
something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
"sub foo;" or "package FOO;" to enter a "forward" declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="dump()-better-written-as-CORE%3a%3adump()"></a><b>dump() better written as CORE::dump()</b>
<p>(W misc) You used the obsolescent <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/dump.html">dump()</a></code> built-in function, without fully
qualifying it as <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::dump</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.  Maybe it's a typo.  See <a href="functions/dump.html">dump</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="dump-is-not-supported"></a><b>dump is not supported</b>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support dump/undump.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Duplicate-free()-ignored"></a><b>Duplicate free() ignored</b>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had
already been freed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Duplicate-modifier-'%25c'-after-'%25c'-in-%25s"></a><b>Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s</b>
<p>(W) You have applied the same modifier more than once after a type
in a pack template.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="elseif-should-be-elsif"></a><b>elseif should be elsif</b>
<p>(S syntax) There is no keyword "elseif" in Perl because Larry thinks
it's ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method
named "elseif" for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Empty-%25s"></a><b>Empty %s</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code>
 are used to introduce a named Unicode property, as
described in <a href="perlunicode.html">perlunicode</a> and <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.  You used <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code>
 in
a regular expression without specifying the property name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="entering-effective-%25s-failed"></a><b>entering effective %s failed</b>
<p>(F) While under the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">filetest</span></code>
 pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25ENV-is-aliased-to-%25s"></a><b>%ENV is aliased to %s</b>
<p>(F) You're running under taint mode, and the <code class="inline"><span class="i">%ENV</span></code>
 variable has been
aliased to another hash, so it doesn't reflect anymore the state of the
program's environment.  This is potentially insecure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Error-converting-file-specification-%25s"></a><b>Error converting file specification %s</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the
conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s%3a-Eval-group-in-insecure-regular-expression"></a><b>%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression</b>
<p>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains the <code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion, which
is unsafe.  See <a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>, and <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s%3a-Eval-group-not-allowed-at-runtime%2c-use-re-'eval'"></a><b>%s: Eval-group not allowed at runtime, use re 'eval'</b>
<p>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
<code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk,
it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by using the
<code class="inline"><span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;eval&#39;</span></code>
 pragma or by explicitly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an eval().  See
<a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s%3a-Eval-group-not-allowed%2c-use-re-'eval'"></a><b>%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'</b>
<p>(F) A regular expression contained the <code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width
assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;eval&#39;</span></code>

pragma is in effect.  See <a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="EVAL-without-pos-change-exceeded-limit-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>EVAL without pos change exceeded limit in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) You used a pattern that nested too many EVAL calls without consuming
any text.  Restructure the pattern so that text is consumed.</p>
<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Excessively-long-%3c%3e-operator"></a><b>Excessively long &lt;&gt; operator</b>
<p>(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt; operator may not exceed the maximum size of a
Perl identifier.  If you're just trying to glob a long list of
filenames, try using the glob() operator, or put the filenames into a
variable and glob that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="exec%3f-I'm-not-*that*-kind-of-operating-system"></a><b>exec? I'm not *that* kind of operating system</b>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> function is not implemented on some systems, e.g., Symbian
OS.  See <a href="perlport.html">perlport</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Execution-of-%25s-aborted-due-to-compilation-errors."></a><b>Execution of %s aborted due to compilation errors.</b>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a Perl compilation fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-eval-via-%25s"></a><b>Exiting eval via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-format-via-%25s"></a><b>Exiting format via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a format by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-pseudo-block-via-%25s"></a><b>Exiting pseudo-block via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a rather special block construct (like a
sort block or subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a
loop control statement.  See <a href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-subroutine-via-%25s"></a><b>Exiting subroutine via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a subroutine by unconventional means, such
as a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-substitution-via-%25s"></a><b>Exiting substitution via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a substitution by unconventional means, such
as a return, a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Explicit-blessing-to-''-(assuming-package-main)"></a><b>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</b>
<p>(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has
the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is
usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target package,
e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s%3a-Expression-syntax"></a><b>%s: Expression syntax</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-failed--call-queue-aborted"></a><b>%s failed--call queue aborted</b>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a UNITCHECK,
CHECK, INIT, or END subroutine.  Processing of the remainder of the
queue of such routines has been prematurely ended.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="False-%5b%5d-range-%22%25s%22-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>False [] range "%s" in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal
character, not another character class like <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">[:alpha:]</code>.  The "-"
in your false range is interpreted as a literal "-".  Consider quoting the
"-", "\-".  The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the
problem was discovered.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Fatal-VMS-error-(status%3d%25d)-at-%25s%2c-line-%25d"></a><b>Fatal VMS error (status=%d) at %s, line %d</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS
system service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more
details.  The filename in "at %s" and the line number in "line %d" tell
you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="fcntl-is-not-implemented"></a><b>fcntl is not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement fcntl().  What is this, a
PDP-11 or something?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="FETCHSIZE-returned-a-negative-value"></a><b>FETCHSIZE returned a negative value</b>
<p>(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which
is not possible.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Field-too-wide-in-'u'-format-in-pack"></a><b>Field too wide in 'u' format in pack</b>
<p>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string start with a length indicator
which can't encode values above 63.  So there is no point in asking for
a line length bigger than that.  Perl will behave as if you specified
<code class="inline"><span class="w">u63</span></code>
 as the format.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-input"></a><b>Filehandle %s opened only for input</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended
it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with "+&lt;" or
"+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If you intended only to
write the file, use "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-output"></a><b>Filehandle %s opened only for output</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If
you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it
with "+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&gt;".  If you intended only to
read from the file, use "&lt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.  Another possibility
is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for
output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-%25s-reopened-as-%25s-only-for-input"></a><b>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input</b>
<p>(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDOUT or STDERR.  This occurred because you closed STDOUT or STDERR
previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-STDIN-reopened-as-%25s-only-for-output"></a><b>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output</b>
<p>(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDIN.  This occurred because you closed STDIN previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Final-%24-should-be-%5c%24-or-%24name"></a><b>Final $ should be \$ or $name</b>
<p>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or the
name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="flock()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>flock() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to flock() got itself closed
some time before now.  Check your control flow.  flock() operates on
filehandles.  Are you attempting to call flock() on a dirhandle by the
same name?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Format-not-terminated"></a><b>Format not terminated</b>
<p>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Format-%25s-redefined"></a><b>Format %s redefined</b>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="s">{</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;redefine&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&quot;format NAME =...&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a name="Found-%3d-in-conditional%2c-should-be-%3d%3d"></a><b>Found = in conditional, should be ==</b>
<p>(W syntax) You said</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> = <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></li></ol></pre><p>when you meant</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> == <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></li></ol></pre><p>(or something like that).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-found-where-operator-expected"></a><b>%s found where operator expected</b>
<p>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
operator, it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gdbm-store-returned-%25d%2c-errno-%25d%2c-key-%22%25s%22"></a><b>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key "%s"</b>
<p>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gethostent-not-implemented"></a><b>gethostent not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement gethostent(), probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="get%25sname()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>get%sname() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="getpwnam-returned-invalid-UIC-%25%23o-for-user-%22%25s%22"></a><b>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user "%s"</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  The call to <code class="inline"><span class="w">sys</span><span class="i">$getuai</span></code>
 underlying the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/getpwnam.html">getpwnam</a></code> operator returned an invalid UIC.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="getsockopt()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>getsockopt() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket.  Did you
forget to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/getsockopt.html">getsockopt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Global-symbol-%22%25s%22-requires-explicit-package-name"></a><b>Global symbol "%s" requires explicit package name</b>
<p>(F) You've said "use strict" or "use strict vars", which indicates 
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using "my" or "state"), 
declared beforehand using "our", or explicitly qualified to say 
which package the global variable is in (using "::").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="glob-failed-(%25s)"></a><b>glob failed (%s)</b>
<p>(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used
for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">&lt;*.c&gt;</span></code>
.  Usually, this means that you supplied a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code>
pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell)
is broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables
in config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as
if it were csh (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="w">full_csh</span>=<span class="q">&#39;/usr/bin/tcsh&#39;</span></code>
); otherwise, make them
all empty (except that <code class="inline"><span class="w">d_csh</span></code>
 should be <code class="inline"><span class="q">&#39;undef&#39;</span></code>
) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<code class="inline">./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Glob-not-terminated"></a><b>Glob not terminated</b>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gmtime(%25f)-too-large"></a><b>gmtime(%f) too large</b>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> with a number that was larger than
it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> probably returned the wrong
date.  This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special
not-a-number value).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gmtime(%25f)-too-small"></a><b>gmtime(%f) too small</b>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> with a number that was smaller than
it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/gmtime.html">gmtime</a></code> probably returned the wrong date.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Got-an-error-from-DosAllocMem"></a><b>Got an error from DosAllocMem</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to OS/2.  Most probably you're using an obsolete
version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="goto-must-have-label"></a><b>goto must have label</b>
<p>(F) Unlike with "next" or "last", you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Goto-undefined-subroutine%25s"></a><b>Goto undefined subroutine%s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to call a subroutine with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto.html">goto</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span></code>
 syntax, but
the indicated subroutine hasn't been defined, or if it was, it
has since been undefined.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="()-group-starts-with-a-count"></a><b>()-group starts with a count</b>
<p>(F) A ()-group started with a count.  A count is supposed to follow
something: a template character or a ()-group.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-had-compilation-errors."></a><b>%s had compilation errors.</b>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Had-to-create-%25s-unexpectedly"></a><b>Had to create %s unexpectedly</b>
<p>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hash-%25%25s-missing-the-%25-in-argument-%25d-of-%25s()"></a><b>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</b>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-has-too-many-errors"></a><b>%s has too many errors</b>
<p>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Having-no-space-between-pattern-and-following-word-is-deprecated"></a><b>Having no space between pattern and following word is deprecated</b>
<p>(D syntax)</p>
<p>You had a word that isn't a regex modifier immediately following
a pattern without an intervening space.  If you are trying to use
the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/le</span></code>
 flags on a substitution, use <code class="inline"><span class="q">/el</span></code>
 instead.  Otherwise, add
white space between the pattern and following word to eliminate
the warning.  As an example of the latter, the two constructs:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li> <span class="i">$a</span> =~ <span class="q">m/$foo/sand</span> <span class="i">$bar</span></li><li> <span class="i">$a</span> =~ <span class="q">m/$foo/s</span> and <span class="i">$bar</span></li></ol></pre><p>both currently mean the same thing, but it is planned to disallow
the first form in Perl 5.18.  And,</p>

<li><a name="Hexadecimal-number-%3e-0xffffffff-non-portable"></a><b>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Identifier-too-long"></a><b>Identifier too long</b>
<p>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$A::B</span></code>
).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ignoring-zero-length-%5cN%7b%7d-in-character-class"></a><b>Ignoring zero length \N{} in character class</b>
<p>(W) Named Unicode character escapes <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span>\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 may return a zero-length
sequence.  When such an escape is used in a character class its
behaviour is not well defined.  Check that the correct escape has
been used, and the correct charname handler is in scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s"></a><b>Illegal binary digit %s</b>
<p>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a

offending digit.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-after-'_'-in-prototype-for-%25s-%3a-%25s"></a><b>Illegal character after '_' in prototype for %s : %s</b>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-%5c%25o-(carriage-return)"></a><b>Illegal character \%o (carriage return)</b>
<p>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-in-prototype-for-%25s-%3a-%25s"></a><b>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</b>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-declaration-of-anonymous-subroutine"></a><b>Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine</b>
<p>(F) When using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a></code> keyword to construct an anonymous subroutine,
you must always specify a block of code.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-declaration-of-subroutine-%25s"></a><b>Illegal declaration of subroutine %s</b>
<p>(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-division-by-zero"></a><b>Illegal division by zero</b>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-hexadecimal-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or
A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal
number stopped before the illegal character.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-modulus-zero"></a><b>Illegal modulus zero</b>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most
numbers don't take to this kindly.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-number-of-bits-in-vec"></a><b>Illegal number of bits in vec</b>
<p>(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be a power of
two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-octal-digit-%25s"></a><b>Illegal octal digit %s</b>
<p>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-octal-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal octal digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number.

</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-switch-in-PERL5OPT%3a--%25c"></a><b>Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: -%c</b>
<p>(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to set the

</li>
<li><a name="Ill-formed-CRTL-environ-value-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Ill-formed CRTL environ value "%s"</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's
internal environ array, and encountered an element without the <code class="inline">=</code>

delimiter used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ill-formed-message-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%7c%25s%7c"></a><b>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical
name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and
didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(in-cleanup)-%25s"></a><b>(in cleanup) %s</b>
<p>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>
<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">G_KEEPERR</span></code>
 flag could
also result in this warning.  See <a href="perlcall.html#G_KEEPERR">G_KEEPERR in perlcall</a>.</p>

<p>(F) The method resolution order (MRO) of the given class is not
C3-consistent, and you have enabled the C3 MRO for this class.  See the C3
documentation in <a href="mro.html">mro</a> for more information.</p>

<li><a name="In-EBCDIC-the-v-string-components-cannot-exceed-2147483647"></a><b>In EBCDIC the v-string components cannot exceed 2147483647</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to EBCDIC.  Internally, v-strings are stored as
Unicode code points, and encoded in EBCDIC as UTF-EBCDIC.  The UTF-EBCDIC
encoding is limited to code points no larger than 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Infinite-recursion-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Infinite recursion in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) You used a pattern that references itself without consuming any input
text.  You should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns
either consume text or fail.</p>
<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Initialization-of-state-variables-in-list-context-currently-forbidden"></a><b>Initialization of state variables in list context currently forbidden</b>
<p>(F) Currently the implementation of "state" only permits the
initialization of scalar variables in scalar context.  Re-write
<code class="inline"><span class="w">state</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$a</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="n">42</span></code>
 as <code class="inline"><span class="w">state</span> <span class="i">$a</span> = <span class="n">42</span></code>
 to change from list to scalar

supported in a future perl release.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Insecure-dependency-in-%25s"></a><b>Insecure dependency in %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify <b>-T</b> to turn it on explicitly.  The
tainting mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly
from the user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any
such data is used in a "dangerous" operation, you get this error.  See
<a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Insecure-directory-in-%25s"></a><b>Insecure directory in %s</b>
<p>(F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or
setgid script if <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
 contains a directory that is writable by
the world.  Also, the PATH must not contain any relative directory.
See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>

 are derived from data
supplied (or potentially supplied) by the user.  The script must set
the path to a known value, using trustworthy data.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Insecure-user-defined-property-%25s"></a><b>Insecure user-defined property %s</b>
<p>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains a call to a user-defined character property
function, i.e. <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">IsFoo</span><span class="s">}</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-format-string-for-%25s"></a><b>Integer overflow in format string for %s</b>
<p>(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/printf.html">printf()</a></code>
or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sprintf.html">sprintf()</a></code> are too large.  The numbers must not overflow the size of
integers for your architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-%25s-number"></a><b>Integer overflow in %s number</b>
<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
either as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is too big for
your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.
On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-version"></a><b>Integer overflow in version</b>
<p>(F) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for the
size of integers for your architecture.  This is not a warning
because there is no rational reason for a version to try and use a
element larger than typically 2**32.  This is usually caused by
trying to use some odd mathematical operation as a version, like
100/9.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Internal-disaster-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Internal disaster in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>

discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Internal-inconsistency-in-tracking-vforks"></a><b>Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number of times
you've called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fork.html">fork</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code>, to determine whether the current call
to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
<a href="perlvms.html#exec-LIST">exec LIST in perlvms</a>).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so
Perl is making a guess and treating this <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> as a request to
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Internal-urp-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Internal urp in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(P) Something went badly awry in the regular expression parser.  The

</li>
<li><a name="%25s-(...)-interpreted-as-function"></a><b>%s (...) interpreted as function</b>
<p>(W syntax) You've run afoul of the rule that says that any list operator
followed by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list
operators arguments found inside the parentheses.  See
<a href="perlop.html#Terms-and-List-Operators-(Leftward)">Terms and List Operators (Leftward) in perlop</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-%25s-attribute%3a-%25s"></a><b>Invalid %s attribute: %s</b>
<p>(F) The indicated attribute for a subroutine or variable was not recognized
by Perl or by a user-supplied handler.  See <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-%25s-attributes%3a-%25s"></a><b>Invalid %s attributes: %s</b>
<p>(F) The indicated attributes for a subroutine or variable were not

</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-conversion-in-%25s%3a-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Invalid conversion in %s: "%s"</b>
<p>(W printf) Perl does not understand the given format conversion.  See
<a href="functions/sprintf.html">sprintf</a>.</p>
</li>

<p>(W regexp) The numeric escape (for example <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xHH</span></code>
) of value &lt; 256
didn't correspond to a single character through the conversion
from the encoding specified by the encoding pragma.
The escape was replaced with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) instead.
The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the
escape was discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-hexadecimal-number-in-%5cN%7bU%2b...%7d"></a><b>Invalid hexadecimal number in \N{U+...}</b>
<p>(F) The character constant represented by <code class="inline">...</code>
 is not a valid hexadecimal
number.  Either it is empty, or you tried to use a character other than
0 - 9 or A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-module-name-%25s-with--%25c-option%3a-contains-single-'%3a'"></a><b>Invalid module name %s with -%c option: contains single ':'</b>
<p>(F) The module argument to perl's <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> command-line options
cannot contain single colons in the module name, but only in the
arguments after "=".  In other words, <b>-MFoo::Bar=:baz</b> is ok, but
<b>-MFoo:Bar=baz</b> is not.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-mro-name%3a-'%25s'"></a><b>Invalid mro name: '%s'</b>
<p>(F) You tried to <code class="inline"><span class="i">mro::set_mro</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">&quot;classname&quot;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">mro</span> <span class="q">'foo'</span></code>
,
where <code class="inline"><span class="w">foo</span></code>
 is not a valid method resolution order (MRO).  Currently,
the only valid ones supported are <code class="inline"><span class="w">dfs</span></code>
 and <code class="inline"><span class="w">c3</span></code>
, unless you have loaded
a module that is a MRO plugin.  See <a href="mro.html">mro</a> and <a href="perlmroapi.html">perlmroapi</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="invalid-option--D%25c%2c-use--D''-to-see-choices"></a><b>invalid option -D%c, use -D'' to see choices</b>
<p>(F) Perl was called with invalid debugger flags.  Call perl with

See also <a href="perlrun.html#-Dletters">-Dletters in perlrun</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-%5b%5d-range-%22%25s%22-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Invalid [] range "%s" in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) The range specified in a character class had a minimum character
greater than the maximum character.  One possibility is that you forgot the
<code class="inline"><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 from your ending <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 - <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x</span></code>
 without the curly braces can go only
up to <code class="inline"><span class="w">ff</span></code>
.  The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the

</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-range-%22%25s%22-in-transliteration-operator"></a><b>Invalid range "%s" in transliteration operator</b>
<p>(F) The range specified in the tr/// or y/// operator had a minimum

</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-separator-character-%25s-in-attribute-list"></a><b>Invalid separator character %s in attribute list</b>
<p>(F) Something other than a colon or whitespace was seen between the
elements of an attribute list.  If the previous attribute had a
parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was terminated too soon.
See <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-separator-character-%25s-in-PerlIO-layer-specification-%25s"></a><b>Invalid separator character %s in PerlIO layer specification %s</b>
<p>(W layer) When pushing layers onto the Perl I/O system, something other
than a colon or whitespace was seen between the elements of a layer list.
If the previous attribute had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that

</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-strict-version-format-(%25s)"></a><b>Invalid strict version format (%s)</b>
<p>(F) A version number did not meet the "strict" criteria for versions.
A "strict" version number is a positive decimal number (integer or
decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal
v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three components.
The parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.
See the <a href="version.html">version</a> module for more details on allowed version formats.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-type-'%25s'-in-%25s"></a><b>Invalid type '%s' in %s</b>
<p>(F) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
<p>(W) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type but used to be
silently ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-version-format-(%25s)"></a><b>Invalid version format (%s)</b>
<p>(F) A version number did not meet the "lax" criteria for versions.
A "lax" version number is a positive decimal number (integer or
decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal
v-string.  If the v-string has fewer than three components, it
must have a leading 'v' character.  Otherwise, the leading 'v' is
optional.  Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a
trailing "alpha" component separated by an underscore character
after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.  The parenthesized
text indicates which criteria were not met.  See the <a href="version.html">version</a> module
for more details on allowed version formats.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Invalid-version-object"></a><b>Invalid version object</b>
<p>(F) The internal structure of the version object was invalid.
Perhaps the internals were modified directly in some way or
an arbitrary reference was blessed into the "version" class.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="ioctl-is-not-implemented"></a><b>ioctl is not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement ioctl(), which is pretty
strange for a machine that supports C.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="ioctl()-on-unopened-%25s"></a><b>ioctl() on unopened %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried ioctl() on a filehandle that was never opened.
Check your control flow and number of arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="IO-layers-(like-'%25s')-unavailable"></a><b>IO layers (like '%s') unavailable</b>
<p>(F) Your Perl has not been configured to have PerlIO, and therefore
you cannot use IO layers.  To have PerlIO, Perl must be configured
with 'useperlio'.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="IO%3a%3aSocket%3a%3aatmark-not-implemented-on-this-architecture"></a><b>IO::Socket::atmark not implemented on this architecture</b>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't implement the sockatmark() functionality,
neither as a system call nor an ioctl call (SIOCATMARK).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%24*-is-no-longer-supported"></a><b>$* is no longer supported</b>
<p>(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$*</span></code>
, deprecated in older
perls, has been removed as of 5.9.0 and is no longer supported.  In
previous versions of perl the use of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$*</span></code>
 enabled or disabled multi-line
matching within a string.</p>
<p>Instead of using <code class="inline"><span class="i">$*</span></code>
 you should use the <code class="inline">/m</code> (and maybe <code class="inline">/s</code>) regexp
modifiers.  You can enable <code class="inline">/m</code> for a lexical scope (even a whole file)
with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;/m&#39;</span></code>
.  (In older versions: when <code class="inline"><span class="i">$*</span></code>
 was set to a true value
then all regular expressions behaved as if they were written using <code class="inline">/m</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%24%23-is-no-longer-supported"></a><b>$# is no longer supported</b>
<p>(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$#</span></code>
, deprecated in older
perls, has been removed as of 5.9.3 and is no longer supported.  You
should use the printf/sprintf functions instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%25s'-is-not-a-code-reference"></a><b>'%s' is not a code reference</b>
<p>(W overload) The second (fourth, sixth, ...) argument of

an anonymous subroutine, or a reference to a subroutine.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%25s'-is-not-an-overloadable-type"></a><b>'%s' is not an overloadable type</b>
<p>(W overload) You tried to overload a constant type the overload package is

<li><a name="length%2fcode-after-end-of-string-in-unpack"></a><b>length/code after end of string in unpack</b>
<p>(F) While unpacking, the string buffer was already used up when an unpack
length/code combination tried to obtain more data.  This results in
an undefined value for the length.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="length()-used-on-%25s"></a><b>length() used on %s</b>
<p>(W syntax) You used length() on either an array or a hash when you
probably wanted a count of the items.</p>
<p>Array size can be obtained by doing:</p>

<li><a name="Lexing-code-attempted-to-stuff-non-Latin-1-character-into-Latin-1-input"></a><b>Lexing code attempted to stuff non-Latin-1 character into Latin-1 input</b>
<p>(F) An extension is attempting to insert text into the current parse
(using <a href="perlapi.html#lex_stuff_pvn">lex_stuff_pvn</a> or similar), but tried to insert a character that
couldn't be part of the current input.  This is an inherent pitfall
of the stuffing mechanism, and one of the reasons to avoid it.  Where
it is necessary to stuff, stuffing only plain ASCII is recommended.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Lexing-code-internal-error-(%25s)"></a><b>Lexing code internal error (%s)</b>
<p>(F) Lexing code supplied by an extension violated the lexer's API in a
detectable way.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="listen()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>listen() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a listen on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/listen.html">listen</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="List-form-of-piped-open-not-implemented"></a><b>List form of piped open not implemented</b>
<p>(F) On some platforms, notably Windows, the three-or-more-arguments
form of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a></code> does not support pipes, such as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$pipe</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;|-&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">@args</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="localtime(%25f)-too-large"></a><b>localtime(%f) too large</b>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/localtime.html">localtime</a></code> with a number that was larger
than it can reliably handle and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/localtime.html">localtime</a></code> probably returned the

handle.  This restriction may be eased in a future release.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Lost-precision-when-%25s-%25f-by-1"></a><b>Lost precision when %s %f by 1</b>
<p>(W) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one is too large
for the underlying floating point representation to store accurately,
hence the target of <code class="inline">++</code>
 or <code class="inline">--</code>
 is unchanged.  Perl issues this warning
because it has already switched from integers to floating point when values
are too large for integers, and now even floating point is insufficient.
You may wish to switch to using <a href="Math/BigInt.html">Math::BigInt</a> explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="lstat()-on-filehandle%25s"></a><b>lstat() on filehandle%s</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to do an lstat on a filehandle.  What did you mean
by that?  lstat() makes sense only on filenames.  (Perl did a fstat()
instead on the filehandle.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="lvalue-attribute-%25s-already-defined-subroutine"></a><b>lvalue attribute %s already-defined subroutine</b>
<p>(W misc) Although <a href="attributes.html">attributes.pm</a> allows this, turning the lvalue
attribute on or off on a Perl subroutine that is already defined
does not always work properly.  It may or may not do what you
want, depending on what code is inside the subroutine, with exact
details subject to change between Perl versions.  Only do this
if you really know what you are doing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="lvalue-attribute-ignored-after-the-subroutine-has-been-defined"></a><b>lvalue attribute ignored after the subroutine has been defined</b>
<p>(W misc) Using the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">lvalue</span></code>
 declarative syntax to make a Perl

</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-prototype-for-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><b>Malformed prototype for %s: %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype.  The
syntax of function prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for
obvious errors like invalid characters.  A more rigorous check is run
when the function is called.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-UTF-8-character-(%25s)"></a><b>Malformed UTF-8 character (%s)</b>
<p>(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a string that didn't comply with UTF-8
encoding rules, even though it had the UTF8 flag on.</p>
<p>One possible cause is that you set the UTF8 flag yourself for data that
you thought to be in UTF-8 but it wasn't (it was for example legacy
8-bit data).  To guard against this, you can use Encode::decode_utf8.</p>
<p>If you use the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="i">encoding</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">UTF</span>-<span class="n">8</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 PerlIO layer for input, invalid byte
sequences are handled gracefully, but if you use <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code>
, the flag is
set without validating the data, possibly resulting in this error
message.</p>
<p>See also <a href="Encode.html#Handling-Malformed-Data">Handling Malformed Data in Encode</a>.</p>

<p>(W regexp) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.  The &lt;-- HERE
shows in the regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Maximal-count-of-pending-signals-(%25u)-exceeded"></a><b>Maximal count of pending signals (%u) exceeded</b>
<p>(F) Perl aborted due to too high a number of signals pending.  This
usually indicates that your operating system tried to deliver signals
too fast (with a very high priority), starving the perl process from
resources it would need to reach a point where it can process signals
safely.  (See <a href="perlipc.html#Deferred-Signals-(Safe-Signals)">Deferred Signals (Safe Signals) in perlipc</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22%25s%22-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word"></a><b>"%s" may clash with future reserved word</b>
<p>(W) This warning may be due to running a perl5 script through a perl4

"use" or "my".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%25'-may-not-be-used-in-pack"></a><b>'%' may not be used in pack</b>
<p>(F) You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum, because the
checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the other way.
See <a href="functions/unpack.html">unpack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Method-for-operation-%25s-not-found-in-package-%25s-during-blessing"></a><b>Method for operation %s not found in package %s during blessing</b>

<li><a name="Might-be-a-runaway-multi-line-%25s-string-starting-on-line-%25d"></a><b>Might be a runaway multi-line %s string starting on line %d</b>
<p>(S) An advisory indicating that the previous error may have been caused
by a missing delimiter on a string or pattern, because it eventually
ended earlier on the current line.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Misplaced-_-in-number"></a><b>Misplaced _ in number</b>
<p>(W syntax) An underscore (underbar) in a numeric constant did not
separate two digits.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-argument-in-%25s"></a><b>Missing argument in %s</b>
<p>(W uninitialized) A printf-type format required more arguments than were

<li><a name="Missing-argument-to--%25c"></a><b>Missing argument to -%c</b>
<p>(F) The argument to the indicated command line switch must follow
immediately after the switch, without intervening spaces.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-braces-on-%5cN%7b%7d"></a><b>Missing braces on \N{}</b>
<p>(F) Wrong syntax of character name literal <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">charname</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 within
double-quotish context.  This can also happen when there is a space
(or comment) between the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 and the <code class="inline">{</code> in a regex with the <code class="inline">/x</code> modifier.
This modifier does not change the requirement that the brace immediately
follow the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-braces-on-%5co%7b%7d"></a><b>Missing braces on \o{}</b>
<p>(F) A <code class="inline">\<span class="w">o</span></code>
 must be followed immediately by a <code class="inline">{</code> in double-quotish context.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-comma-after-first-argument-to-%25s-function"></a><b>Missing comma after first argument to %s function</b>
<p>(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or an
"indirect object" before the argument list, this ain't one of them.</p>
</li>

 construction, but the command was missing or
blank.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-control-char-name-in-%5cc"></a><b>Missing control char name in \c</b>
<p>(F) A double-quoted string ended with "\c", without the required control
character name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-name-in-%22my-sub%22"></a><b>Missing name in "my sub"</b>
<p>(F) The reserved syntax for lexically scoped subroutines requires that
they have a name with which they can be found.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-%24-on-loop-variable"></a><b>Missing $ on loop variable</b>
<p>(F) Apparently you've been programming in <b>csh</b> too much.  Variables
are always mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it
can vary from one line to the next.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Missing-operator-before-%25s%3f)"></a><b>(Missing operator before %s?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  Often the missing operator is a comma.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-right-brace-on-%25s"></a><b>Missing right brace on %s</b>
<p>(F) Missing right brace in <code class="inline">\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
, or <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-right-brace-on-%5cN%7b%7d-or-unescaped-left-brace-after-%5cN"></a><b>Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 has two meanings.</p>
<p>The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces,
meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name.  Thus <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">ASTERISK</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 is another way of writing <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code>
, valid in both
double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns.  In patterns,
it doesn't have the meaning an unescaped <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code>
 does.</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.12.0, <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 also can have an additional meaning (only)
in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.  (This is short
for <code class="inline">[^\n]</code>, and like <code class="inline">.</code> but is not affected by the <code class="inline">/s</code> regex modifier.)</p>
<p>This can lead to some ambiguities.  When <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 is not followed immediately
by a left brace, Perl assumes the <code class="inline">[^\n]</code> meaning.  Also, if the braces
form a valid quantifier such as <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">5</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, Perl assumes that this
means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples,
3; and 5 or more, respectively).  In all other case, where there is a
<code class="inline">\N{</code> and a matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.</p>
<p>However, if there is no matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl doesn't know if it was
mistakenly omitted, or if <code class="inline">[^\n]{</code> was desired, and raises this error.
If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter,
escape the brace with a backslash, like so: <code class="inline">\N\{</code></p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-right-curly-or-square-bracket"></a><b>Missing right curly or square bracket</b>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
ones.  As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you
were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Missing-semicolon-on-previous-line%3f)"></a><b>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  Don't automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Modification-of-a-read-only-value-attempted"></a><b>Modification of a read-only value attempted</b>
<p>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn't, of course, try "2 = 1", because the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="mod"></a>    sub <span class="m">mod</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$_</span>[<span class="n">0</span>] = <span class="n">1</span> <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="i">mod</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Another way is to assign to a substr() that's off the end of the string.</p>
<p>Yet another way is to assign to a <code class="inline">foreach</code>

<li><a name="Modification-of-non-creatable-array-value-attempted%2c-%25s"></a><b>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
backwards.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Modification-of-non-creatable-hash-value-attempted%2c-%25s"></a><b>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, %s</b>
<p>(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence, and it
couldn't be created for some peculiar reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Module-name-must-be-constant"></a><b>Module name must be constant</b>
<p>(F) Only a bare module name is allowed as the first argument to a "use".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Module-name-required-with--%25c-option"></a><b>Module name required with -%c option</b>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline">-M</code>

you omitted the name of the module.  Consult <a href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a> for full details
about <code class="inline">-M</code>
 and <code class="inline">-m</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="More-than-one-argument-to-'%25s'-open"></a><b>More than one argument to '%s' open</b>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a></code> function has been asked to open multiple files.  This
can happen if you are trying to open a pipe to a command that takes a
list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify a piped open mode.
See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="msg%25s-not-implemented"></a><b>msg%s not implemented</b>
<p>(F) You don't have System V message IPC on your system.</p>

.
They're written like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">1</span>][<span class="n">2</span>][<span class="n">3</span>]</code>
, as in C.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'%2f'-must-follow-a-numeric-type-in-unpack"></a><b>'/' must follow a numeric type in unpack</b>
<p>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '/', but this did not
follow some unpack specification producing a numeric value.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22my-sub%22-not-yet-implemented"></a><b>"my sub" not yet implemented</b>

<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use
local() if you want to localize a package variable.</p>
</li>

<p>(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.
If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message.  The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our.html">our</a></code> declaration is
provided for this purpose.</p>
<p>NOTE: This warning detects symbols that have been used only once so $c, @c,
%c, *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered
the same; if a program uses $c only once but also uses any of the others it
will not trigger this warning.</p>

<li><a name="%5cN-in-a-character-class-must-be-a-named-character%3a-%5cN%7b...%7d"></a><b>\N in a character class must be a named character: \N{...}</b>
<p>(F) The new (5.12) meaning of <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 as <code class="inline">[^\n]</code> is not valid in a bracketed
character class, for the same reason that <code class="inline">.</code> in a character class loses
its specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably not

<li><a name="%5cN%7bNAME%7d-must-be-resolved-by-the-lexer"></a><b>\N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer</b>
<p>(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or
sequence was encountered.  This can happen in any of several ways that
bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra
backslash in double-quotish:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&#39;\N{SPACE}&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/$re/</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># ok</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/$re/</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from smaller
components:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$re</span> = <span class="q">&#39;\N&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/${re}{SPACE}/</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li></ol></pre><p>It's not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like this, and it
doesn't work here.  Instead use the solution above.</p>
<p>Finally, the message also can happen under the <code class="inline">/x</code> regex modifier when the
<code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code>
 is separated by spaces from the <code class="inline">{</code>, in which case, remove the spaces.</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="q">/\N {SPACE}/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># Wrong!</span></li><li>    <span class="q">/\N{SPACE}/x</span><span class="sc">;</span>	<span class="c"># ok</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a name="Negative-'%2f'-count-in-unpack"></a><b>Negative '/' count in unpack</b>
<p>(F) The length count obtained from a length/code unpack operation was
negative.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Negative-length"></a><b>Negative length</b>
<p>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer
length that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Negative-offset-to-vec-in-lvalue-context"></a><b>Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</b>
<p>(F) When <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/vec.html">vec</a></code> is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Nested-quantifiers-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses.
So things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.  The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.</p>
<p>Note that the minimal matching quantifiers, <code class="inline"><span class="i">*?</span></code>
, <code class="inline">+?</code>, and
<code class="inline"><span class="q">??</span></code>
 appear to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-never-introduced"></a><b>%s never introduced</b>
<p>(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of
scope before it could possibly have been used.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="next%3a%3amethod%2fnext%3a%3acan%2fmaybe%3a%3anext%3a%3amethod-cannot-find-enclosing-method"></a><b>next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method cannot find enclosing method</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::method</a></code> needs to be called within the context of a
real method in a real package, and it could not find such a context.
See <a href="mro.html">mro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-%25s-allowed-while-running-setuid"></a><b>No %s allowed while running setuid</b>
<p>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there
will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
securable.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-code-specified-for--%25c"></a><b>No code specified for -%c</b>
<p>(F) Perl's <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> command-line options require an argument.  If
you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a separate
argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="w">perl</span> -e <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></li><li>    <span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">e0</span></li><li>    <span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">e1</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a name="No-comma-allowed-after-%25s"></a><b>No comma allowed after %s</b>
<p>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or "indirect object" is
not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.</p>
<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported
a constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating
system does not support that particular constant.  Hopefully you did
use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see;
please see <a href="functions/use.html">use</a> and <a href="functions/import.html">import</a>.  While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error earlier
it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system
still does not support that constant.  Maybe you have a typo in
the constants of the symbol import list of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the
constant name at the line where this error was triggered?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-command-into-which-to-pipe-on-command-line"></a><b>No command into which to pipe on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-DB%3a%3aDB-routine-defined"></a><b>No DB::DB routine defined</b>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a <code class="inline"><span class="w">Devel::</span></code>

module) didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-dbm-on-this-machine"></a><b>No dbm on this machine</b>
<p>(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM.  See <a href="SDBM_File.html">SDBM_File</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-DB%3a%3asub-routine-defined"></a><b>No DB::sub routine defined</b>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a <code class="inline"><span class="w">Devel::</span></code>

module) didn't define a <code class="inline"><span class="w">DB::sub</span></code>
 routine to be called at the beginning
of each ordinary subroutine call.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-directory-specified-for--I"></a><b>No directory specified for -I</b>
<p>(F) The <b>-I</b> command-line switch requires a directory name as part of the
<i>same</i> argument.  Use <b>-Ilib</b>, for instance.  <b>-I lib</b> won't work.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-error-file-after-2%3e-or-2%3e%3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '2&gt;' or a '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stderr.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-group-ending-character-'%25c'-found-in-template"></a><b>No group ending character '%c' found in template</b>
<p>(F) A pack or unpack template has an opening '(' or '[' without its
matching counterpart.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-input-file-after-%3c-on-command-line"></a><b>No input file after &lt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '&lt;' on the command line, but can't find the
name of the file from which to read data for stdin.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-next%3a%3amethod-'%25s'-found-for-%25s"></a><b>No next::method '%s' found for %s</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::method</a></code> found no further instances of this method name
in the remaining packages of the MRO of this class.  If you don't want
it throwing an exception, use <code class="inline"><span class="w">maybe::next::method</span></code>

or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::can</a></code>.  See <a href="mro.html">mro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22no%22-not-allowed-in-expression"></a><b>"no" not allowed in expression</b>
<p>(F) The "no" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and
returns no useful value.  See <a href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-output-file-after-%3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No output file after &gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you wanted to redirect stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-output-file-after-%3e-or%3e%3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No output file after &gt; or&gt;&gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '&gt;' or a '&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-package-name-allowed-for-variable-%25s-in-%22our%22"></a><b>No package name allowed for variable %s in "our"</b>
<p>(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in "our"
declarations, because that doesn't make much sense under existing
semantics.  Such syntax is reserved for future extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-Perl-script-found-in-input"></a><b>No Perl script found in input</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -x</code>
, but no line was found in the file beginning
with #! and containing the word "perl".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-setregid-available"></a><b>No setregid available</b>
<p>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setregid() call for
your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-setreuid-available"></a><b>No setreuid available</b>
<p>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setreuid() call for
your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-class-field-%22%25s%22-in-variable-%25s-of-type-%25s"></a><b>No such class field "%s" in variable %s of type %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to access a key from a hash through the indicated typed
variable but that key is not allowed by the package of the same type.
The indicated package has restricted the set of allowed keys using the
<a href="fields.html">fields</a> pragma.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-class-%25s"></a><b>No such class %s</b>
<p>(F) You provided a class qualifier in a "my", "our" or "state"
declaration, but this class doesn't exist at this point in your program.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-hook%3a-%25s"></a><b>No such hook: %s</b>
<p>(F) You specified a signal hook that was not recognized by Perl.
Currently, Perl accepts <code class="inline"><span class="w">__DIE__</span></code>
 and <code class="inline"><span class="w">__WARN__</span></code>
 as valid signal hooks.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-pipe-open"></a><b>No such pipe open</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine my_pclose() tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught
earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-signal%3a-SIG%25s"></a><b>No such signal: SIG%s</b>
<p>(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was
not recognized.  Say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/kill.html">kill</a> -l</code>
 in your shell to see the valid signal
names on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-CODE-reference"></a><b>Not a CODE reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-format-reference"></a><b>Not a format reference</b>
<p>(F) I'm not sure how you managed to generate a reference to an anonymous
format, but this indicates you did, and that it didn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-GLOB-reference"></a><b>Not a GLOB reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a "typeglob" (that is, a
symbol table entry that looks like <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span></code>
), but found a reference to
something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to find out what
kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-HASH-reference"></a><b>Not a HASH reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a
reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to
find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-an-ARRAY-reference"></a><b>Not an ARRAY reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-an-unblessed-ARRAY-reference"></a><b>Not an unblessed ARRAY reference</b>
<p>(F) You passed a reference to a blessed array to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/shift.html">shift</a></code> or
another array function.  These only accept unblessed array references
or arrays beginning explicitly with <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-SCALAR-reference"></a><b>Not a SCALAR reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-subroutine-reference"></a><b>Not a subroutine reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-subroutine-reference-in-overload-table"></a><b>Not a subroutine reference in overload table</b>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-enough-arguments-for-%25s"></a><b>Not enough arguments for %s</b>
<p>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-enough-format-arguments"></a><b>Not enough format arguments</b>
<p>(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line
supplied.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s%3a-not-found"></a><b>%s: not found</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="no-UTC-offset-information%3b-assuming-local-time-is-UTC"></a><b>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent
to UTC.  If it's not, define the logical name
<i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to translate to the number of seconds which
need to be added to UTC to get local time.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Non-octal-character-'%25c'.--Resolved-as-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Non-octal character '%c'.  Resolved as "%s"</b>
<p>(W digit) In parsing an octal numeric constant, a character was
unexpectedly encountered that isn't octal.  The resulting value
is as indicated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Non-string-passed-as-bitmask"></a><b>Non-string passed as bitmask</b>
<p>(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to select().
Use the vec() function to construct the file descriptor bitmasks for
select.  See <a href="functions/select.html">select</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-filename-used"></a><b>Null filename used</b>
<p>(F) You can't require the null filename, especially because on many
machines that means the current directory!  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-OP-IN-RUN"></a><b>NULL OP IN RUN</b>
<p>(S debugging) Some internal routine called run() with a null opcode
pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-picture-in-formline"></a><b>Null picture in formline</b>
<p>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you
supplied it an uninitialized value.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-realloc"></a><b>Null realloc</b>
<p>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-regexp-argument"></a><b>NULL regexp argument</b>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-regexp-parameter"></a><b>NULL regexp parameter</b>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Number-too-long"></a><b>Number too long</b>
<p>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to
about 250 characters.  You've exceeded that length.  Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In
the meantime, try using scientific notation (e.g. "1e6" instead of
"1_000_000").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Number-with-no-digits"></a><b>Number with no digits</b>
<p>(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like
a number.  This happens, for example with <code class="inline">\<span class="w">o</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
, with no number between
the braces.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Octal-number-%3e-037777777777-non-portable"></a><b>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-arguments-for-overload%3a%3aconstant"></a><b>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</b>
<p>(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of
arguments.  The arguments should come in pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-elements-in-anonymous-hash"></a><b>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</b>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-elements-in-hash-assignment"></a><b>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</b>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Offset-outside-string"></a><b>Offset outside string</b>
<p>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation
with an offset pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to
imagine.  The sole exceptions to this are that zero padding will
take place when going past the end of the string when either
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sysread.html">sysread()</a></code>ing a file, or when seeking past the end of a scalar opened
for I/O (in anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behaviour
with real files).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s()-on-unopened-%25s"></a><b>%s() on unopened %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was
never initialized.  You need to do an open(), a sysopen(), or a socket()
call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle package.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="-%25s-on-unopened-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>-%s on unopened filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle
that isn't open.  Check your control flow.  See also <a href="functions/-X.html">-X</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="oops%3a-oopsAV"></a><b>oops: oopsAV</b>
<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="oops%3a-oopsHV"></a><b>oops: oopsHV</b>
<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Opening-dirhandle-%25s-also-as-a-file"></a><b>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file</b>
<p>(W io, deprecated) You used open() to associate a filehandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Opening-filehandle-%25s-also-as-a-directory"></a><b>Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</b>
<p>(W io, deprecated) You used opendir() to associate a dirhandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a filehandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Operation-%22%25s%22%3a-no-method-found%2c-%25s"></a><b>Operation "%s": no method found, %s</b>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no
handler was defined.  While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms
of other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless
the <code class="inline"><span class="w">fallback</span></code>
 overloading key is specified to be true.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Operation-%22%25s%22-returns-its-argument-for-non-Unicode-code-point-0x%25X"></a><b>Operation "%s" returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X</b>
<p>(W utf8, non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do
is not defined.  Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.</p>
<p>If the operation shown is "ToFold", it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;non_unicode&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Operation-%22%25s%22-returns-its-argument-for-UTF-16-surrogate-U%2b%25X"></a><b>Operation "%s" returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</b>
<p>(W utf8, surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a Unicode surrogate.  Unicode frowns upon the use of
surrogates for anything but storing strings in UTF-16, but semantics
are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are to do
nothing for this operation.  Because the use of surrogates can be
dangerous, Perl warns.</p>
<p>If the operation shown is "ToFold", it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;surrogate&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Operator-or-semicolon-missing-before-%25s"></a><b>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</b>
<p>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say "*foo *foo" it will be interpreted as if you said
"*foo * 'foo'".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22our%22-variable-%25s-redeclared"></a><b>"our" variable %s redeclared</b>
<p>(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before
in the current lexical scope.</p>

<li><a name="Out-of-memory!"></a><b>Out of memory!</b>
<p>(X) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has
no option but to exit immediately.</p>
<p>At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use <code class="inline"><span class="w">limit</span></code>
 and
<code class="inline"><span class="w">limit</span> <span class="w">datasize</span> <span class="w">n</span></code>
 (where <code class="inline"><span class="w">n</span></code>
 is the number of kilobytes) to check
the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use <code class="inline"><span class="w">ulimit</span> -<span class="w">a</span></code>

and <code class="inline"><span class="w">ulimit</span> -d <span class="w">n</span></code>
, respectively.</p>

the largest possible memory allocation.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-%22large%22-request-for-%25s"></a><b>Out of memory during "large" request for %s</b>
<p>(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a
possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-request-for-%25s"></a><b>Out of memory during request for %s</b>
<p>(X)(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.</p>
<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$^M</span></code>
 as an
emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the error
is trappable <i>once</i>, and the error message will include the line and file
where the failed request happened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-ridiculously-large-request"></a><b>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</b>
<p>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+"small amount" bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$arr</span>[<a class="l_k" href="functions/time.html">time</a>]</code>
 instead of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$arr</span>[<span class="i">$time</span>]</code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-for-yacc-stack"></a><b>Out of memory for yacc stack</b>
<p>(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue
parsing, but realloc() wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or
otherwise.</p>

<li><a name="%25s-package-attribute-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word%3a-%25s"></a><b>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</b>
<p>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a

<p>(F) The code you are trying to run has asked for a newer version of
Perl than you are running.  Perhaps <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="n">5.10</span></code>

.  Without the leading <code class="inline"><span class="w">v</span></code>
, the number is
interpreted as a decimal, with every three digits after the

<p>(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the

<p>(W ambiguous) You said something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/$\/</a></code> in a regex.
The regex <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo$\s+bar/m</a></code> translates to: match the word 'foo', the output
record separator (see <a href="perlvar.html#%24%5c">$\ in perlvar</a>) and the letter 's' (one time or more)
followed by the word 'bar'.</p>
<p>If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning by using 
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/${\}/</a></code> (for example: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo${\}s+bar/</a></code>).</p>
<p>If instead you intended to match the word 'foo' at the end of the line
followed by whitespace and the word 'bar' on the next line then you can use
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/$(?)\/</a></code> (for example: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m/foo$(?)\s+bar/</a></code>).</p>

<li><a name="%5cp%7b%7d-uses-Unicode-rules%2c-not-locale-rules"></a><b>\p{} uses Unicode rules, not locale rules</b>
<p>(W) You compiled a regular expression that contained a Unicode property
match (<code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code>
), but the regular expression is also being told to
use the run-time locale, not Unicode.  Instead, use a POSIX character
class, which should know about the locale's rules.
(See <a href="perlrecharclass.html#POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes in perlrecharclass</a>.)</p>
<p>Even if the run-time locale is ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a subset of
Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid for that
subset.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples to help you see what's going on.  If the
locale is ISO 8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the "GREEK
CAPITAL LETTER CHI".  But in Unicode that code point means the
"MULTIPLICATION SIGN" instead, and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 always uses the Unicode
meaning.  That means that <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Alpha</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 won't match, but <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="co">:</span><span class="w">alpha</span><span class="co">:</span><span class="s">]</span><span class="s">]</span></code>

should.  Only in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same
positions as they are in Unicode.  But, even here, some properties give
incorrect results.  An example is <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Changes_When_Uppercased</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 which
is true for "LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS", but since the upper
case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn't
change when upper cased.</p>

 may cause this error.</p>
<p>Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the <i>defined-or</i>

<li><a name="Server-error"></a><b>Server error</b>
<p>(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window
when trying to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web.  The
actual error text varies widely from server to server.  The most
frequently-seen variants are "500 Server error", "Method (something)
not permitted", "Document contains no data", "Premature end of script
headers", and "Did not produce a valid header".</p>
<p><b>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</b>.</p>
<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by
the user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the
user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment
variables (like PATH) from the user it isn't running under, and isn't
in a location where the CGI server can't find it, basically, more or
less.  Please see the following for more information:</p>

<li><a name="setpgrp-can't-take-arguments"></a><b>setpgrp can't take arguments</b>
<p>(F) Your system has the setpgrp() from BSD 4.2, which takes no
arguments, unlike POSIX setpgid(), which takes a process ID and process
group ID.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="setrgid()-not-implemented"></a><b>setrgid() not implemented</b>

</li>
<li><a name="setsockopt()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>setsockopt() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to set a socket option on a closed socket.  Did you
forget to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/setsockopt.html">setsockopt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="shm%25s-not-implemented"></a><b>shm%s not implemented</b>
<p>(F) You don't have System V shared memory IPC on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="!%3d~-should-be-!~"></a><b>!=~ should be !~</b>
<p>(W syntax) The non-matching operator is !~, not !=~.  !=~ will be
interpreted as the != (numeric not equal) and ~ (1's complement)
operators: probably not what you intended.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%3c%3e-should-be-quotes"></a><b>&lt;&gt; should be quotes</b>
<p>(F) You wrote <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a> <span class="q">&lt;file&gt;</span></code>

<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a> <span class="q">&#39;file&#39;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%2f%25s%2f-should-probably-be-written-as-%22%25s%22"></a><b>/%s/ should probably be written as "%s"</b>
<p>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
as in the first argument to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/join.html">join</a></code>.  Perl will treat the true or false
result of matching the pattern against $_ as the string, which is
probably not what you had in mind.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="shutdown()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><b>shutdown() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a shutdown on a closed socket.  Seems a bit
superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="SIG%25s-handler-%22%25s%22-not-defined"></a><b>SIG%s handler "%s" not defined</b>
<p>(W signal) The signal handler named in %SIG doesn't, in fact, exist.
Perhaps you put it into the wrong package?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Smart-matching-a-non-overloaded-object-breaks-encapsulation"></a><b>Smart matching a non-overloaded object breaks encapsulation</b>
<p>(F) You should not use the <code class="inline">~~</code>
 operator on an object that does not
overload it: Perl refuses to use the object's underlying structure for
the smart match.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="sort-is-now-a-reserved-word"></a><b>sort is now a reserved word</b>
<p>(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Sort-subroutine-didn't-return-single-value"></a><b>Sort subroutine didn't return single value</b>
<p>(F) A sort comparison subroutine may not return a list value with more
or less than one element.  See <a href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Source-filters-apply-only-to-byte-streams"></a><b>Source filters apply only to byte streams</b>
<p>(F) You tried to activate a source filter (usually by loading a
source filter module) within a string passed to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a></code>.  This is
not permitted under the <code class="inline"><span class="w">unicode_eval</span></code>
 feature.  Consider using
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/evalbytes.html">evalbytes</a></code> instead.  See <a href="feature.html">feature</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="splice()-offset-past-end-of-array"></a><b>splice() offset past end of array</b>
<p>(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past the end of
the array passed to splice().  Splicing will instead commence at the
end of the array, rather than past it.  If this isn't what you want,
try explicitly pre-extending the array by assigning $#array = $offset.
See <a href="functions/splice.html">splice</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Split-loop"></a><b>Split loop</b>
<p>(P) The split was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a split shouldn't
iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.)  See <a href="functions/split.html">split</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Statement-unlikely-to-be-reached"></a><b>Statement unlikely to be reached</b>
<p>(W exec) You did an exec() with some statement after it other than a
die().  This is almost always an error, because exec() never returns
unless there was a failure.  You probably wanted to use system()
instead, which does return.  To suppress this warning, put the exec() in
a block by itself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22state%22-variable-%25s-can't-be-in-a-package"></a><b>"state" variable %s can't be in a package</b>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use
local() if you want to localize a package variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="stat()-on-unopened-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>stat() on unopened filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to use the stat() function on a filehandle that
was either never opened or has since been closed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Stub-found-while-resolving-method-%22%25s%22-overloading-%22%25s%22-in-package-%22%25s%22"></a><b>Stub found while resolving method "%s" overloading "%s" in package "%s"</b>
<p>(P) Overloading resolution over @ISA tree may be broken by importation
stubs.  Stubs should never be implicitly created, but explicit calls to
<code class="inline"><span class="w">can</span></code>
 may break this.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Subroutine-%25s-redefined"></a><b>Subroutine %s redefined</b>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine.  To suppress this warning, say</p>

<li><a name="Substitution-loop"></a><b>Substitution loop</b>
<p>(P) The substitution was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a substitution
shouldn't iterate more times than there are characters of input, which
is what happened.)  See the discussion of substitution in

</li>
<li><a name="Substitution-pattern-not-terminated"></a><b>Substitution pattern not terminated</b>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the interior delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span></code>

 may cause this error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="substr-outside-of-string"></a><b>substr outside of string</b>
<p>(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed outside of
a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the
length of the string.  See <a href="functions/substr.html">substr</a>.  This warning is fatal if
substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand side of an
assignment or as a subroutine argument for example).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="sv_upgrade-from-type-%25d-down-to-type-%25d"></a><b>sv_upgrade from type %d down to type %d</b>
<p>(P) Perl tried to force the upgrade of an SV to a type which was actually
inferior to its current type.</p>

<p>(F) A (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct can have at most
two branches (the if-clause and the else-clause).  If you want one or
both to contain alternation, such as using <code class="inline"><span class="w">this</span>|<span class="w">that</span>|<span class="w">other</span></code>
, enclose
it in clustering parentheses:</p>

error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <b>-w</b>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20 questions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="syntax-error-at-line-%25d%3a-'%25s'-unexpected"></a><b>syntax error at line %d: '%s' unexpected</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p>(F) This error is likely to occur if you run a perl5 script through
a perl4 interpreter, especially if the next 2 tokens are "use strict"

</li>
<li><a name="System-V-%25s-is-not-implemented-on-this-machine"></a><b>System V %s is not implemented on this machine</b>
<p>(F) You tried to do something with a function beginning with "sem",
"shm", or "msg" but that System V IPC is not implemented in your
machine.  In some machines the functionality can exist but be
unconfigured.  Consult your system support.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="syswrite()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>syswrite() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
before now.  Check your control flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="-T-and--B-not-implemented-on-filehandles"></a><b><code class="inline">-T</code>
 and <code class="inline">-B</code>

<p>(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
know about your kind of stdio.  You'll have to use a filename instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Target-of-goto-is-too-deeply-nested"></a><b>Target of goto is too deeply nested</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto.html">goto</a></code> to reach a label that was too deeply nested
for Perl to reach.  Perl is doing you a favor by refusing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="telldir()-attempted-on-invalid-dirhandle-%25s"></a><b>telldir() attempted on invalid dirhandle %s</b>
<p>(W io) The dirhandle you tried to telldir() is either closed or not really
a dirhandle.  Check your control flow.</p>

</li>
<li><a name="The-crypt()-function-is-unimplemented-due-to-excessive-paranoia"></a><b>The crypt() function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia</b>
<p>(F) Configure couldn't find the crypt() function on your machine,
probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they
think the U.S. Government thinks it's a secret, or at least that they
will continue to pretend that it is.  And if you quote me on that, I
will deny it.</p>
</li>

<p>(F) The function indicated isn't implemented on this architecture, according
to the probings of Configure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="The-stat-preceding-%25s-wasn't-an-lstat"></a><b>The stat preceding %s wasn't an lstat</b>
<p>(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic

<p>(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS.  You tried to change or delete an
element of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl
wasn't built with a CRTL that contained the setenv() function.  You'll
need to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine
<i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that the environ array isn't the
target of the change to
%ENV which produced the warning.</p>

</li>
<li><a name="%22-T%22-is-on-the-%23!-line%2c-it-must-also-be-used-on-the-command-line"></a><b>"-T" is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line</b>
<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains
the <b>-T</b> option (or the <b>-t</b> option), but Perl was not invoked with
<b>-T</b> in its command line.  This is an error because, by the time
Perl discovers a <b>-T</b> in a script, it's too late to properly taint
everything from the environment.  So Perl gives up.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be
fixed by editing the #! line so that the <b>-%c</b> option is a part of
Perl's first argument: e.g. change <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">n</span> -<span class="i">%c</span></code>
 to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="i">%c</span> -<span class="w">n</span></code>
.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> <span class="w">scriptname</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="To%25s%3a-illegal-mapping-'%25s'"></a><b>To%s: illegal mapping '%s'</b>
<p>(F) You tried to define a customized To-mapping for lc(), lcfirst,

</li>
<li><a name="Too-late-for-%22-%25s%22-option"></a><b>Too late for "-%s" option</b>
<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
<b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b> or <b>-C</b> option.</p>
<p>In the case of <b>-M</b> and <b>-m</b>, this is an error because those options
are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> pragma instead.</p>
<p>The <b>-C</b> option only works if it is specified on the command line as
well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers following).  Either
specify this option on the command line, or, if your system supports
it, make your script executable and run it directly instead of passing
it to perl.</p>

<p>(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run time proper,

<p>(F) The subroutine in question in the CORE package requires its argument
to be a hard reference to data of the specified type.  Overloading is
ignored, so a reference to an object that is not the specified type, but
nonetheless has overloading to handle it, will still not be accepted.</p>

<li><a name="Unicode-non-character-U%2b%25X-is-illegal-for-open-interchange"></a><b>Unicode non-character U+%X is illegal for open interchange</b>
<p>(W utf8, nonchar) Certain codepoints, such as U+FFFE and U+FFFF, are
defined by the Unicode standard to be non-characters.  Those are
legal codepoints, but are reserved for internal use; so, applications
shouldn't attempt to exchange them.  If you know what you are doing

<li><a name="Unicode-surrogate-U%2b%25X-is-illegal-in-UTF-8"></a><b>Unicode surrogate U+%X is illegal in UTF-8</b>
<p>(W utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are
not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and
U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message
came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn
off this warning by <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;surrogate&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

<p>(W layer) An attempt was made to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O
system.  (Layers take care of transforming data between external and

<li><a name="Unknown-process-%25x-sent-message-to-prime_env_iter%3a-%25s"></a><b>Unknown process %x sent message to prime_env_iter: %s</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl was reading values for %ENV before

<li><a name="Unsuccessful-%25s-on-filename-containing-newline"></a><b>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline</b>
<p>(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that
operation failed, PROBABLY because the filename contained a newline,
PROBABLY because you forgot to chomp() it off.  See <a href="functions/chomp.html">chomp</a>.</p>

<p>(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.</p>
<p>Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be different flavors

<li><a name="Unterminated-attribute-list"></a><b>Unterminated attribute list</b>
<p>(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the
start of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a

<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>

<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a

often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said</p>

apart from the array, like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push(@x)</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/unshift.html">unshift(@foo)</a></code>.  That won't
usually have any effect on the array, so is completely useless.  It's
possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect
if the array is tied to a class which implements a PUSH method.  If so,
you can write it as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push(@tied_array,())</a></code> to avoid this warning.</p>

<li><a name="Use-of-freed-value-in-iteration"></a><b>Use of freed value in iteration</b>
<p>(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?
This error is typically caused by code like the following:</p>

For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the
middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-*glob%7bFILEHANDLE%7d-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated</b>

<p>(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-inherited-AUTOLOAD-for-non-method-%25s()-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>

subroutines are looked up as methods (using the <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ISA</span></code>
 hierarchy)
even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">Foo::bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
), not as methods (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo</span><span class="w">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$obj</span><span class="i">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
).</p>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.</p>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
 for non-methods from a base class
named <code class="inline"><span class="w">BaseClass</span></code>
, execute <code class="inline"><span class="i">*AUTOLOAD</span> = \<span class="i">&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</span></code>
 during
startup.</p>
<p>In code that currently says <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="i">@ISA</span> = <span class="q">qw(AutoLoader)</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 to
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span> <span class="q">&#39;AUTOLOAD&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Use-of--l-on-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>Use of -l on filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file
it already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.
The operation returned <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a></code>.  Use a filename instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-%25s-on-a-handle-without-*-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of %s on a handle without * is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You used <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tie.html">tie</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tied.html">tied</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/untie.html">untie</a></code> on a scalar but that scalar
happens to hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will be tied.  If
you mean to tie a handle, use an explicit * as in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tie.html">tie</a> <span class="i">*$handle</span></code>
.</p>
<p>This was a long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there was
no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and no way to
untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.  If you see this
message, you must be using an older version.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-%3fPATTERN%3f-without-explicit-operator-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of ?PATTERN? without explicit operator is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You have written something like <code class="inline"><span class="q">?\w?</span></code>
, for a regular
expression that matches only once.  Starting this term directly with
the question mark delimiter is now deprecated, so that the question mark
will be available for use in new operators in the future.  Write <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m?\w?</a></code>
instead, explicitly using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m.html">m</a></code> operator: the question mark delimiter
still invokes match-once behaviour.</p>

<li><a name="Use-of-qw(...)-as-parentheses-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of qw(...) as parentheses is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You have something like <code class="inline">foreach <span class="i">$x</span> <span class="q">qw(a b c)</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
,
using a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qw.html">qw(...)</a></code> list literal where a parenthesised expression is
expected.  Historically the parser fooled itself into thinking that
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qw.html">qw(...)</a></code> literals were always enclosed in parentheses, and as a result
you could sometimes omit parentheses around them.  (You could never do
the <code class="inline">foreach <span class="q">qw(a b c)</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
 that you might have expected, though.)
The parser no longer lies to itself in this way.  Wrap the list literal
in parentheses, like <code class="inline">foreach <span class="i">$x</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="q">qw(a b c)</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-reference-%22%25s%22-as-array-index"></a><b>Use of reference "%s" as array index</b>
<p>(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably

<li><a name="Use-of-reserved-word-%22%25s%22-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of reserved word "%s" is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future
versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you're better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of
use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be
suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;</span></code>
 prefix, or using
a package qualifier, e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;our</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, or <code class="inline"><span class="i">Foo::our</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-tainted-arguments-in-%25s-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated</b>
<p>(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/system.html">system()</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec()</a></code> with multiple
arguments and at least one of them is tainted.  This used to be allowed
but will become a fatal error in a future version of perl.  Untaint your
arguments.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-uninitialized-value%25s"></a><b>Use of uninitialized value%s</b>
<p>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.</p>
<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you
the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases
it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the
undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
anid the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
literally in your program.  For example, <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;that $foo&quot;</span></code>
 is usually
optimized into <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;that &quot;</span> . <span class="i">$foo</span></code>
, and the warning will refer to the
<code class="inline">concatenation (.)</code> operator, even though there is no <code class="inline">.</code> in
your program.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Using-a-hash-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a><b>Using a hash as a reference is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">%foo</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;bar&quot;</span>}</code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">%$ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;hello&quot;</span>}</code>
.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.   It is now
deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Using-an-array-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a><b>Using an array as a reference is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">23</span>]</code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">@$ref</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">99</span>]</code>
.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to
allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.  It is now deprecated,
and will be removed in a future version.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Using-just-the-first-character-returned-by-%5cN%7b%7d-in-character-class"></a><b>Using just the first character returned by \N{} in character class</b>
<p>(W) A charnames handler may return a sequence of more than one character.
Currently all but the first one are discarded when used in a regular
expression pattern bracketed character class.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Using-!~-with-%25s-doesn't-make-sense"></a><b>Using !~ with %s doesn't make sense</b>
<p>(F) Using the <code class="inline">!~</code>
 operator with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///r</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr///r</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/y.html">y///r</a></code> is
currently reserved for future use, as the exact behaviour has not
been decided.  (Simply returning the boolean opposite of the
modified string is usually not particularly useful.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="UTF-16-surrogate-U%2b%25X"></a><b>UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</b>
<p>(W utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are
not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and
U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message
came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn
off this warning by <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;surrogate&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Value-of-%25s-can-be-%220%22%3b-test-with-defined()"></a><b>Value of %s can be "0"; test with defined()</b>
<p>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob),
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/each.html">each()</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/readdir.html">readdir()</a></code> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs
can return a value of "0"; that would make the conditional expression
false, which is probably not what you intended.  When using these
constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a></code> operator.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Value-of-CLI-symbol-%22%25s%22-too-long"></a><b>Value of CLI symbol "%s" too long</b>
<p>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an
%ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant string
longer than 1024 characters.  The return value has been truncated to
1024 characters.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-available"></a><b>Variable "%s" is not available</b>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.)  For example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="f"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$a</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely,
the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">'sub f { $a }'</span> <span class="s">}</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">'$a'</span> <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="i">f</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being
executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-imported%25s"></a><b>Variable "%s" is not imported%s</b>
<p>(W misc) With "use strict" in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-length-lookbehind-not-implemented-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and
known at compile time.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%22%25s%22-variable-%25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%25s"></a><b>"%s" variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</b>
<p>(W misc) A "my", "our" or "state" variable has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the
previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note
that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope
or until all closure referents to it are destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-syntax"></a><b>Variable syntax</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-%22%25s%22-will-not-stay-shared"></a><b>Variable "%s" will not stay shared</b>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="vector-argument-not-supported-with-alpha-versions"></a><b>vector argument not supported with alpha versions</b>
<p>(W internal) The %vd (s)printf format does not support version objects
with alpha parts.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Verb-pattern-'%25s'-has-a-mandatory-argument-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Verb pattern '%s' has a mandatory argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) You used a verb pattern that requires an argument.  Supply an

</li>
<li><a name="Verb-pattern-'%25s'-may-not-have-an-argument-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f"></a><b>Verb pattern '%s' may not have an argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) You used a verb pattern that is not allowed an argument.  Remove the 
argument or check that you are using the right verb.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Version-number-must-be-a-constant-number"></a><b>Version number must be a constant number</b>
<p>(P) The attempt to translate a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">Module</span> <span class="w">n</span>.<span class="w">n</span> <span class="w">LIST</span></code>
 statement into
its equivalent <code class="inline">BEGIN</code>
 block found an internal inconsistency with
the version number.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Version-string-'%25s'-contains-invalid-data%3b-ignoring%3a-'%25s'"></a><b>Version string '%s' contains invalid data; ignoring: '%s'</b>
<p>(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at the end, which
are being ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Warning%3a-something's-wrong"></a><b>Warning: something's wrong</b>
<p>(W) You passed warn() an empty string (the equivalent of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/warn.html">warn</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$@</span></code>
 was empty.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Warning%3a-unable-to-close-filehandle-%25s-properly"></a><b>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</b>
<p>(S) The implicit close() done by an open() got an error indication on
the close().  This usually indicates your file system ran out of disk
space.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Warning%3a-Use-of-%22%25s%22-without-parentheses-is-ambiguous"></a><b>Warning: Use of "%s" without parentheses is ambiguous</b>
<p>(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that
looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a
term or unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand
function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a> + <span class="n">5</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span> + <span class="n">5</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>but in actual fact, you got</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">+5</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Wide-character-in-%25s"></a><b>Wide character in %s</b>
<p>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting
one.  This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).  The easiest
way to quiet this warning is simply to add the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code>
 layer to the
output, e.g. <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a> <span class="w">STDOUT</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;:utf8&#39;</span></code>
.  Another way to turn off the
warning is to add <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;utf8&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 but that is often closer to
cheating.  In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the
filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="open.html">open</a> and <a href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Within-%5b%5d-length-'%25c'-not-allowed"></a><b>Within []-length '%c' not allowed</b>
<p>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">TEMPLATE</span><span class="s">]</span></code>

only if <code class="inline"><span class="w">TEMPLATE</span></code>
 always matches the same amount of packed bytes that
can be determined from the template alone.  This is not possible if
it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length.  Redesign
the template.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="write()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><b>write() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
before now.  Check your control flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="%25s-%22%5cx%25X%22-does-not-map-to-Unicode"></a><b>%s "\x%X" does not map to Unicode</b>
<p>(F) When reading in different encodings Perl tries to map everything
into Unicode characters.  The bytes you read in are not legal in
this encoding, for example</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    utf8 "\xE4" does not map to Unicode</li></ol></pre><p>if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'X'-outside-of-string"></a><b>'X' outside of string</b>
<p>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
the beginning of the string being (un)packed.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'x'-outside-of-string-in-unpack"></a><b>'x' outside of string in unpack</b>
<p>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after
the end of the string being unpacked.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="YOU-HAVEN'T-DISABLED-SET-ID-SCRIPTS-IN-THE-KERNEL-YET!"></a><b>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</b>
<p>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip
about what you want.  Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around
your script.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="You-need-to-quote-%22%25s%22"></a><b>You need to quote "%s"</b>
<p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared,
which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.  (If it IS
what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Your-random-numbers-are-not-that-random"></a><b>Your random numbers are not that random</b>
<p>(F) When trying to initialise the random seed for hashes, Perl could
not get any randomness out of your system.  This usually indicates
Something Very Wrong.</p>
